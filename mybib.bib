abstract = {Approximately half of the planets discovered by NASA's Kepler mission are in systems where just a single planet transits its host star, and the remaining planets are observed to be in multi-planet systems. Recent analyses have reported a dichotomy in the eccentricity distribution displayed by systems where a single planet transits compared with that displayed by the multi-planet systems. Using {\$}N{\$}-body simulations, we examine the hypothesis that this dichotomy has arisen because inner systems of super-Earths are frequently accompanied by outer systems of giant planets that can become dynamically unstable and perturb the inner systems. Our initial conditions are constructed using a subset of the known Kepler five-planet systems as templates for the inner systems, and systems of outer giant planets with masses between those of Neptune and Saturn that are centred on orbital radii {\$}2 \backslashle a{\_}{\{}\backslashrm p{\}} \backslashle 10{\$} au. The parameters of the outer systems are chosen so that they are always below an assumed radial velocity detection threshold of 3 ms{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}. The results show an inverse relation between the mean eccentricities and the multiplicites of the systems. Performing synthetic transit observation of the final systems reveals dichotomies in both the eccentricity and multiplicity distributions that are close to being in agreement with the Kepler data. Hence, understanding the observed orbital and physical properties of the compact systems of super-Earths discovered by Kepler may require holistic modelling that couples the dynamics of both inner and outer systems of planets during and after the epoch of formation.},

abstract = {We report on the properties of eclipsing binaries (EBs) from the Kepler mission with a newly developed photometric modelling code, which uses the light curve, spectral energy distribution of each binary, and stellar evolution models to infer stellar masses without the need for radial velocity (RV) measurements. We present solutions and posteriors to orbital and stellar parameters for 728 systems, forming the largest homogeneous catalogue of full Kepler binary parameter estimates to date. Using comparisons to published RV measurements, we demonstrate that the inferred properties (e.g. masses) are reliable for well-detached mainsequence (MS) binaries, which make up the majority of our sample. The fidelity of our inferred parameters degrades for a subset of systems not well described by input isochrones, such as short-period binaries that have undergone interactions, or binaries with post-MS components. Additionally, we identify 35 new systems which show evidence of eclipse timing variations, perhaps from apsidal motion due to binary tides or tertiary companions. We plan to subsequently use these models to search for and constrain the presence of circumbinary planets in Kepler EB systems.},

abstract = {One of the major atmospheric features in exoplanet atmospheres, detectable both from ground- and space-based facilities, is Rayleigh scattering. In hydrogen-dominated planetary atmospheres Rayleigh scattering causes the measured planetary radius to increase towards blue wavelengths in the optical range. We obtained a spectrophotometic time series of one transit of the Saturn-mass planet WASP-69b using the OSIRIS instrument at the Gran Telescopio Canarias. From the data we construct 19 spectroscopic transit light curves representing 20 nm wide wavelength bins spanning from 515 nm - 905 nm. We derive the transit depth for each curve individually by fitting an analytical model together with a Gaussian Processes to account for systematic noise in the light curves. We find that the transit depth increases towards bluer wavelengths, indicative of a larger effective planet radius. Our results are consistent with space-based measurements obtained in the near infrared using the Hubble Space telescope, which show a compatible slope of the transmission spectrum. We discuss the origin of the detected slope and argue between two possible scenarios: a Rayleigh scattering detection originating in the planet's atmosphere or a stellar activity induced signal from the host star.},

@article{Rosenblatt1971,
abstract = {The transit of a star by a dark companion or planet results in a characteristic colorimetric "signature," which should be detectable by photometric means. This signature, which is due to differential limb darkening in red and blue light, takes the form of a slight shift towards the blue as the planet crosses the limb of the star, followed by an abnormal reddening during the transit of the center region of the star, and finally another shift towards the blue as the planet approaches the far limb. An analysis of this signature, the probabilities of detecting such transits (using the solar system as a model), and possible instrumentation for this purpose are discussed. A system designed to yield one or more planetary detections per year is believed to be feasible at moderate cost. Such a system would consist of three wide-field telescopes, at well-separated sites, slaved to a central computer. Each telescope would be equipped with a two-color photometer employing an image dissector under computer control for tracking and rapid switching between program stars without requiring frequent resetting of the instrument. Each telescope would survey an independent sample of stars on a rapid rotation cycle, until one of the telescopes detected an unusual transient, at which time all three would be used to provide additional data and increased reliability as a coincidence detection system. {\textcopyright} 1971.},

abstract = {We present the results of a comprehensive assessment of companions to solar-type stars. A sample of 454 stars, including the Sun, was selected from the Hipparcos catalog with$\pi$ {\textgreater} 40 mas, $\sigma$$\pi$/$\pi$ {\textless} 0.05, 0.5 ≤ B - V ≤ 1.0 (∼F6-K3), and constrained by absolute magnitude and color to exclude evolved stars. These criteria are equivalent to selecting all dwarf and subdwarf stars within 25 pc with V-band flux between 0.1 and 10 times that of the Sun, giving us a physical basis for the term "solar-type." New observational aspects of this work include surveys for (1) very close companions with long-baseline interferometry at the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy Array, (2) close companions with speckle interferometry, and (3) wide proper-motion companions identified by blinking multi-epoch archival images. In addition, we include the results from extensive radial-velocity monitoring programs and evaluate companion information from various catalogs covering many different techniques. The results presented here include four new common proper-motion companions discovered by blinking archival images. Additionally, the spectroscopic data searched reveal five new stellar companions. Our synthesis of results from many methods and sources results in a thorough evaluation of stellar and brown dwarf companions to nearby Sun-like stars. The overall observed fractions of single, double, triple, and higher-order systems are 56{\%} ± 2{\%}, 33{\%} ± 2{\%}, 8{\%} ± 1{\%}, and 3{\%} ± 1{\%}, respectively, counting all confirmed stellar and brown dwarf companions. If all candidate, i.e., unconfirmed, companions identified are found to be real, the percentages would change to 54{\%}±2{\%}, 34{\%}±2{\%}, 9{\%}±2{\%}, and 3{\%}±1{\%}, respectively. Our completeness analysis indicates that only a few undiscovered companions remain in this well-studied sample, implying that the majority (54{\%}±2{\%}) of solar-type stars are single, in contrast to the results of prior multiplicity studies. Our sample is large enough to enable a check of the multiplicity dependence on various physical parameters by analyzing appropriate subsamples. Bluer, more massive stars are seen as more likely to have companions than redder, less massive ones, consistent with the trend seen over the entire spectral range. Systems with larger interaction cross sections, i.e., those with more than two components or long orbital periods, are preferentially younger, suggesting that companions may be stripped over time by dynamical interactions.We confirm the planet-metallicity correlation (i.e., higher metallicity stars are more likely to host planets), but are unable to check it for brown dwarfs due to the paucity of such companions, implying that the brown dwarf desert extends over all separation regimes.We find no correlation between stellar companions and metallicity for B -V {\textless} 0.625, but among the redder subset, metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] {\textless} -0.3) are more likely to have companions with a 2.4$\sigma$ significance. The orbital-period distribution of companions is unimodal and roughly log normal with a peak and median of about 300 years. The period-eccentricity relation shows the expected circularization for periods below 12 days, caused by tidal forces over the age of the Galaxy, followed by a roughly flat distribution. The mass-ratio distribution shows a preference for like-mass pairs, which occur more frequently in relatively close pairs. The fraction of planet hosts among single, binary, and multiple systems are statistically indistinguishable, suggesting that planets are as likely to form around single stars as they are around components of binary or multiple systems with sufficiently wide separations. This, along with the preference of long orbital periods among stellar systems, increases the space around stars conducive for planet formation, and perhaps life. {\textcopyright} 2010.

Its large, 105 deg2 field of view features over 156,000 stars that are observed continuously to detect and characterize planet transits. Yet, this high-precision instrument holds great promise for other types of objects as well. Here we present a comprehensive catalog of eclipsing binary stars observed by Kepler in the first 44 days of operation, the data being publicly available through MAST as of 2010 June 15. The catalog contains 1879 unique objects. For each object, we provide its Kepler ID (KID), ephemeris (BJD0, P 0), morphology type, physical parameters (T eff, log g, E(B - V)), the estimate of third light contamination (crowding), and principal parameters (T 2/T 1, q, fillout factor, and sin i for overcontacts, and T 2/T 1, (R 1 + R 2)/a, esin $\omega$, ecos $\omega$, and sin i for detached binaries). We present statistics based on the determined periods and measure the average occurrence rate of eclipsing binaries to be 1.2{\%} across the Kepler field. We further discuss the distribution of binaries as a function of galactic latitude and thoroughly explain the application of artificial intelligence to obtain principal parameters in a matter of seconds for the whole sample.

abstract = {We investigate the astrophysical false-positive configuration in exoplanet-transit surveys. It involves eclipsing binaries and giant planets that present only a secondary eclipse, as seen from the Earth. To test how an eclipsing binary configuration can mimic a planetary transit, we generated synthetic light curves of three examples of secondary-only eclipsing binary systems that we fit with a circular planetary model. Then, to evaluate its occurrence we modeled a population of binaries in double and triple systems based on binary statistics and occurrence. We find that 0.061{\%} ± 0.017{\%} of main-sequence binary stars are secondary-only eclipsing binaries that mimics a planetary transit candidate with a size down to the size of the Earth. We then evaluate the occurrence that an occulting-only giant planet can mimic an Earth-like planet or even a smaller one. We find that 0.009{\%} ± 0.002{\%} of stars harbor a giant plaet that only presents the secondary transit. Occulting-only giant planets mimic planets that are smaller than the Earth, and they are in the scope of space missions like Kepler and PLATO. We estimate that up to 43.1 ± 5.6 Kepler objects of interest can be mimicked by this configuration of false positives, thereby re-evaluating the global false-positive rate of the Kepler mission from 9.4 ± 0.9{\%} to 11.3 ± 1.1{\%}. We note, however, that this new false-positive scenario occurs at relatively long orbital periods compared with the median period of Kepler candidates. {\textcopyright} ESO, 2013.},

abstract = {Using the Optical System for Imaging and low Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy (OSIRIS) instrument installed on the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), we acquired multicolour transit photometry of four small (Rp≲5R⊕) short-period (P ≲ 6d) planet candidates recently identified by the Kepler space mission. These observations are part of a programme to constrain the false positive rate for small, short-period Kepler planet candidates. Since planetary transits should be largely achromatic when observed at different wavelengths (excluding the small colour changes due to stellar limb darkening), we use the observed transit colour to identify candidates as either false positives (e.g. a blend with a stellar eclipsing binary either in the background/foreground or bound to the target star) or validated planets. Our results include the identification of KOI 225.01 and KOI 1187.01 as false positives and the tentative validation of KOI 420.01 and KOI 526.01 as planets. The probability of identifying two false positives out of a sample of four targets is less than 1per cent, assuming an overall false positive rate for Kepler planet candidates of 10per cent (as estimated by Morton {\&} Johnson). Therefore, these results suggest a higher false positive rate for the small, short-period Kepler planet candidates than has been theoretically predicted by other studies which consider the Kepler planet candidate sample as a whole. Furthermore, our results are consistent with a recent Doppler study of short-period giant Kepler planet candidates. We also investigate how the false positive rate for our sample varies with different planetary and stellar properties. Our results suggest that the false positive rate varies significantly with orbital period and is largest at the shortest orbital periods (P {\textless} 3d), where there is a corresponding rise in the number of detached eclipsing binary stars (i.e. systems that can easily mimic planetary transits) that have been discovered by Kepler. However, we do not find significant correlations between the false positive rate and other planetary or stellar properties. Our sample size is not yet large enough to determine if orbital period plays the largest role in determining the false positive rate, but we discuss plans for future observations of additional Kepler candidates and compare our programme focusing on relatively faint Kepler targets from the GTC with follow-up of Kepler targets that has been done with warm-Spitzer. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2012 RAS.},

abstract = {Recent studies claimed that planets around the same star have similar sizes and masses and regular spacings, and that planet pairs usually show ordered sizes such that the outer planet is usually the larger one. Here I show that these patterns can be largely explained by detection biases. The $\backslash$emph{\{}Kepler{\}} planet detections are set by the transit signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). For different stellar properties and orbital period values, the same S/N corresponds to different planetary sizes. This variation in the detection threshold naturally leads to apparent correlations in planet sizes and the observed size ordering. The apparently correlated spacings, measured in period ratios, between adjacent planet pairs in systems with at least three detected planets are partially due to the arbitrary upper limit that the earlier study imposed on the period ratio, and partially due to the varying stability threshold for different planets. After these detection biases are taken into account, we do not find strong evidence for the so-called "intra-system uniformity" or the size ordering effect. Instead, the physical properties of $\backslash$emph{\{}Kepler{\}} planets are largely independent of the properties of their siblings and the parent star. It is likely that the dynamical evolution has erased the memory of $\backslash$emph{\{}Kepler{\}} planets about their initial formation conditions. In other words, it will be difficult to infer the initial conditions from the observed properties and the architecture of $\backslash$emph{\{}Kepler{\}} planets.},

abstract = {We describe TRILEGAL, a new populations synthesis code for simulating the stellar photometry of any Galaxy field. The code attempts to improve upon several technical aspects of star count models, by: dealing with very complete input libraries of evolutionary tracks; using a stellar spectral library to simulate the photometry in virtually any broad-band system; being very versatile allowing easy changes in the input libraries and in the description of all of its ingredients - like the star formation rate, age-metallicity relation, initial mass function, and geometry of Galaxy components. In a previous paper (Groenewegen et al. 2002, Paper I), the code was first applied to describe the very deep star counts of the CDFS stellar catalogue. Here, we briefly describe its initial calibration using EIS-deep and DMS star counts, which, as we show, are adequate samples to probe both the halo and the disc components of largest scale heights (oldest ages). We then present the changes in the calibration that were necessary to cope with some improvements in the model input data, and the use of more extensive photometry datasets: now the code is shown to successfully simulate also the relatively shallower 2MASS catalogue, which probes mostly the disc at intermediate ages, and the immediate solar neighbourhood as sampled by Hipparcos - in particular its absolute magnitude versus colour diagram -, which contains a somewhat larger fraction of younger stars than deeper surveys. Remarkably, the same model calibration can reproduce well the star counts in all the above-mentioned data sets, that span from the very deep magnitudes of CDFS (16 {\textless} R {\textless} 23) to the very shallow ones of Hipparcos (V {\textless} 8). Significant deviations (above 50 percent in number counts) are found just for fields close to the Galactic Center (since no bulge component was included) and Plane, and for a single set of South Galactic Pole data. The TRILEGAL code is ready to use for the variety of wide-angle surveys in the optical/infrared that will become available in the coming years. {\textcopyright} ESO 2005.},

abstract = {Torques from a mutually inclined perturber can change a transiting planet's impact parameter, resulting in variations in the transit shape and duration. Detection of and upper limits on changes in impact parameter yield valuable constraints on a planetary system's three dimensional architecture. Constraints for warm Jupiters are particularly interesting because they allow us to test origins theories that invoke a mutually inclined perturber. Because of warm Jupiters' high signal-to-noise transits, changes in impact parameter are feasible to detect. However, here we show that allowing the impact parameter to vary uniformly and independently from transit to transit leads to incorrect inferences about the change, propagating to incorrect inferences about the perturber. We demonstrate that an appropriate prior on the change in impact parameter mitigates this problem. We apply our approach to eight systems from the literature and find evidence for changes in impact parameter for warm Jupiter Kepler-46b. We conclude with our recommendations for light curve fitting, including when to fit impact parameters vs. transit durations.},

These Kepler targets were prioritized for imaging follow-up based on the presence of small planets, so most of the KOIs in these systems (176 out of 204) have nominal radii {\textless}6 R{\_}E . Each KOI in our sample was observed in at least 2 filters with adaptive optics, speckle imaging, lucky imaging, or HST. Multi-filter photometry provides color information on the companions, allowing us to constrain their stellar properties and assess the probability that the companions are physically bound. We find that 60 -- 80{\%} of companions within 1" are bound, and the bound fraction is {\textgreater}90{\%} for companions within 0.5"; the bound fraction decreases with increasing angular separation. This picture is consistent with simulations of the binary and background stellar populations in the Kepler field. We also reassess the planet radii in these systems, converting the observed differential magnitudes to a contamination in the Kepler bandpass and calculating the planet radius correction factor, {\$}X{\_}R = R{\_}p (true) / R{\_}p (single){\$}. Under the assumption that planets in bound binaries are equally likely to orbit the primary or secondary, we find a mean radius correction factor for planets in stellar multiples of {\$}X{\_}R = 1.65{\$}.

We detect all four HR 8799 planets in each data set at a moderate to high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N ≳ 6-15). We fail to identify a fifth planet, "HR 8799 f," at r {\textless} 15 AU at a 5$\sigma$ confidence level: one suggestive, marginally significant residual at 0.″2 is most likely a point-spread function artifact. Assuming companion ages of 30 Myr and the Baraffe planet cooling models, we rule out an HR 8799 f with a mass of 5 MJ (7 MJ ), 7 MJ (10 MJ ), or 12 MJ (13 MJ ) at r proj 12 AU, 9 AU, and 5 AU, respectively. All four HR 8799 planets have red early T dwarf-like L′-[4.05] colors, suggesting that their spectral energy distributions peak in between the L′ and M′ broadband filters. We find no statistically significant difference in HR 8799 cde's color. Atmosphere models assuming thick, patchy clouds appear to better match HR 8799 bcde's photometry than models assuming a uniform cloud layer. While non-equilibrium carbon chemistry is required to explain HR 8799 b and c's photometry/spectra, evidence for it from HR 8799 d and e's photometry is weaker. Future, deep-IR spectroscopy/spectrophotometry with the Gemini Planet Imager, SCExAO/CHARIS, and other facilities may clarify whether the planets are chemically similar or heterogeneous.},

Here, we provide an updated catalog augmented with the second Kepler data release which increases the baseline nearly fourfold to 125days. Three hundred and eighty-six new systems have been added, ephemerides and principal parameters have been recomputed. We have removed 42 previously cataloged systems that are now clearly recognized as short-period pulsating variables and another 58 blended systems where we have determined that the Kepler target object is not itself the eclipsing binary. A number of interesting objects are identified. We present several exemplary cases: four eclipsing binaries that exhibit extra (tertiary) eclipse events; and eight systems that show clear eclipse timing variations indicative of the presence of additional bodies bound in the system. We have updated the period and galactic latitude distribution diagrams.

We studied the dependence of the observed properties of exoplanets (radius, mass, and orbital period) as a function of their host star metallicity.

With a much larger sample and improved radius measurements, we are able to reconfirm previous results in the literature. We show that the average metallicity of the host star increases as the radius of the planet increases. We demonstrate this by first calculating the average host star metallicity for different radius bins and then supplementing these results by calculating the occurrence rate as a function of planetary radius and host star metallicity. We find a similar trend between host star metallicity and planet mass: the average host star metallicity increases with increasing planet mass. This trend, however, reverses for masses {\$}{\textgreater} 4.0\backslash, M{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}J{\}}{\$}: host star metallicity drops with increasing planetary mass. We further examined the correlation between the host star metallicity and the orbital period of the planet.

abstract = {Exoplanet science is one of the most thriving fields of modern astrophysics. A major goal is the atmospheric characterization of dozens of small, terrestrial exoplanets in order to search for signatures in their atmospheres that indicate biological activity, assess their ability to provide conditions for life as we know it, and investigate their expected atmospheric diversity. None of the currently adopted projects or missions, from ground or in space, can address these goals. In this White Paper we argue that a large space-based mission designed to detect and investigate thermal emission spectra of terrestrial exoplanets in the MIR wavelength range provides unique scientific potential to address these goals and surpasses the capabilities of other approaches. While NASA might be focusing on large missions that aim to detect terrestrial planets in reflected light, ESA has the opportunity to take leadership and spearhead the development of a large MIR exoplanet mission within the scope of the "Voyage 2050" long-term plan establishing Europe at the forefront of exoplanet science for decades to come. Given the ambitious science goals of such a mission, additional international partners might be interested in participating and contributing to a roadmap that, in the long run, leads to a successful implementation. A new, dedicated development program funded by ESA to help reduce development and implementation cost and further push some of the required key technologies would be a first important step in this direction. Ultimately, a large MIR exoplanet imaging mission will be needed to help answer one of mankind's most fundamental questions: "How unique is our Earth?"},

abstract = {Planet formation is generally described in terms of a system containing the host star and a protoplanetary disc, of which the internal properties (e.g. mass and metallicity) determine the properties of the resulting planetary system. However, (proto)planetary systems are predicted and observed to be affected by the spatially-clustered stellar formation environment, either through dynamical star-star interactions or external photoevaporation by nearby massive stars. It is challenging to quantify how the architecture of planetary systems is affected by these environmental processes, because stellar groups spatially disperse within {\textless}1 billion years, well below the ages of most known exoplanets. Here we identify old, co-moving stellar groups around exoplanet host stars in the astrometric data from the Gaia satellite and demonstrate that the architecture of planetary systems exhibits a strong dependence on local stellar clustering in position-velocity phase space, implying a dependence on their formation or evolution environment. After controlling for host stellar age, mass, metallicity, and distance from the Sun, we obtain highly significant differences (with {\$}p{\$}-values of {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}-5{\}}{\{}-{\}}10{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$}) in planetary (system) properties between phase space overdensities and the field. The median semi-major axis and orbital period of planets in overdensities are 0.087 au and 9.6 days, respectively, compared to 0.81 au and 154 days for planets around field stars. 'Hot Jupiters' (massive, close-in planets) predominantly exist in stellar phase space overdensities, strongly suggesting that their extreme orbits originate from environmental perturbations rather than internal migration or planet-planet scattering. Our findings reveal that stellar clustering is a key factor setting the architectures of planetary systems.},

abstract = {For extrasolar planets discovered using the radial velocity method1, the spectral characterization of the host star leads to a mass estimate of the star and subsequently of the orbiting planet. If the orbital velocity of the planet could be determined, the masses of both star and planet could be calculated using Newton's law of gravity, just as in the case of stellar double-line eclipsing binaries. Here we report high-dispersion ground-based spectroscopy of a transit of the extrasolar planet HD209458b. We see a significant wavelength shift in absorption lines from carbon monoxide in the planet's atmosphere, which we conclude arises froma change in the radial component of the planet's orbital velocity. The masses of the star and planet are 1.00±022MSun and 0.64±0.09MJup respectively. A blueshift of the carbon monoxide signal of approximately 2kms-1 with respect to the systemic velocity of the host star suggests the presence of a strong wind flowing from the irradiated dayside to the non-irradiated nightside of the planet within the 0.01-0.1 mbar atmospheric pressure range probed by these observations. The strength of the carbon monoxide signal suggests a carbn monoxide mixing ratio of (1-3)×10-3 in this planet's upper atmosphere. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

With the automated laser adaptive optics instrument, Robo-AO, we have observed 620 nearby stars around 3857 planetary candidates host stars. Many of the nearby stars, however, are not bound to the KOI. In this paper, we quantify the association probability between each KOI and detected nearby stars through several methods. Galactic stellar models and the observed stellar density are used to estimate the number and properties of unbound stars. We estimate the spectral type and distance to 145 KOIs with nearby stars using multi-band observations from Robo-AO and Keck-AO. We find most nearby stars within 1" of a Kepler planetary candidate are likely bound, in agreement with past studies. We use likely bound stars as well as the precise stellar parameters from the California Kepler Survey to search for correlations between stellar binarity and planetary properties. No significant difference between the binarity fraction of single and multiple planet systems is found, and planet hosting stars follow similar binarity trends as field stars, many of which likely host their own non-aligned planets. We find that hot Jupiters are {\~{}}4x more likely than other planets to reside in a binary star system. We correct the radius estimates of the planet candidates in characterized systems and find that for likely bound systems, the estimated planetary candidate radii will increase on average by a factor of 1.77, if either star is equally likely to host the planet. We find that the planetary radius gap is robust to the impact of dilution, and find an intriguing 95{\%}-confidence discrepancy between the radius distribution of small planets in single and binary systems.},

This paper describes how the Kepler CDPP is calculated, and introduces tables of rms CDPP on a per-target basis for 3-, 6-, and 12-hour transit durations, which are now available for all Kepler observations. Quarter 3 is the first typical set of observations at the nominal length and completeness for a quarter, from 2009 September 18 to 2009 December 16, and we examine the properties of the rms CDPP distribution for this data set. Finally, we describe how to employ CDPP to calculate target completeness, an important use case.},

abstract = {Over 30{\%} of the {\~{}}4000 known exoplanets to date have been discovered using 'validation', where the statistical likelihood of a transit arising from a false positive (FP), non-planetary scenario is calculated. For the large majority of these validated planets calculations were performed using the vespa algorithm (Morton et al. 2016). Regardless of the strengths and weaknesses of vespa, it is highly desirable for the catalogue of known planets not to be dependent on a single method. We demonstrate the use of machine learning algorithms, specifically a gaussian process classifier (GPC) reinforced by other models, to perform probabilistic planet validation incorporating prior probabilities for possible FP scenarios. The GPC can attain a mean log-loss per sample of 0.54 when separating confirmed planets from FPs in the Kepler threshold crossing event (TCE) catalogue. Our models can validate thousands of unseen candidates in seconds once applicable vetting metrics are calculated, and can be adapted to work with the active TESS mission, where the large number of observed targets necessitates the use of automated algorithms. We discuss the limitations and caveats of this methodology, and after accounting for possible failure modes newly validate 50 Kepler candidates as planets, sanity checking the validations by confirming them with vespa using up to date stellar information. Concerning discrepancies with vespa arise for many other candidates, which typically resolve in favour of our models. Given such issues, we caution against using single-method planet validation with either method until the discrepancies are fully understood.},

abstract = {When we are fortunate enough to view an exoplanetary system nearly edge-on, the star and planet periodically eclipse each other. Observations of eclipses (transits and occultations) provide a bonanza of information that cannot be obtained from radial-velocity data alone, such as the relative dimensions of the planet and its host star, as well as the orientation of the planet's orbit relative to the sky plane and relative to the stellar rotation axis. The wavelength-dependence of the eclipse signal gives clues about the the temperature and composition of the planetary atmosphere. Anomalies in the timing or other properties of the eclipses may betray the presence of additional planets or moons. Searching for eclipses is also a productive means of discovering new planets. This chapter reviews the basic geometry and physics of eclipses, and summarizes the knowledge that has been gained through eclipse observations, as well as the information that might be gained in the future.},

This study examines planet occurrence rates for the Kepler GK dwarf target sample for planet radii, 0.75 ≤ Rp ≤ 2.5 R⊕, and orbital periods, 50 ≤ Porb ≤ 300 days, with an emphasis on a thorough exploration and identification of the most important sources of systematic uncertainties. Integrating over this parameter space, we measure an occurrence rate of F0 = 0.77 planets per star, with an allowed range of 0.3 ≤ F0 ≤ 1.9. The allowed range takes into account both statistical and systematic uncertainties, and values of F0 beyond the allowed range are significantly in disagreement with our analysis. We generally find higher planet occurrence rates and a steeper increase in planet occurrence rates toward small planets than previous studies of the Kepler GK dwarf sample. Through extrapolation, we find that the one year orbital period terrestrial planet occurrence rate $\zeta$1.0 = 0.1, with an allowed range of 0.01 ≤ $\zeta$1.0 ≤ 2, where $\zeta$1.0 is defined as the number of planets per star within 20{\%} of the Rp and Porb of Earth. For G dwarf hosts, the $\zeta$1.0 parameter space is a subset of the larger $\eta$⊕ parameter space, thus $\zeta$1.0 places a lower limit on $\eta$⊕ for G dwarf hosts. From our analysis, we identify the leading sources of systematics impacting Kepler occurrence rate determinations as reliability of the planet candidate sample, planet radii, pipeline completeness, and stellar parameters.},

abstract = {The radial velocity technique is currently used to classify transiting objects. While capable of identifying grazing binary eclipses, this technique cannot reliably identify blends, a chance overlap of a faint background eclipsing binary with an ordinary foreground star. Blends generally have no observable radial velocity shifts, as the foreground star is brighter by several magnitudes and therefore dominates the spectrum, but their combined light can produce events that closely resemble those produced by transiting exoplanets. The radial velocity technique takes advantage of the mass difference between planets and stars to classify exoplanet candidates. However, the existence of blends renders this difference an unreliable discriminator. Another difference must therefore be utilized for this classification - the physical size of the transiting body. Due to the dependence of limb darkening on color, planets and stars produce subtly different transit shapes. These differences can be relatively weak, little more than 1/10th the transit depth. However, the presence of even small color differences between the individual components of the blend increases this difference. This paper shows that this color difference is capable of discriminating between exoplanets and blends reliably, theoretically capable of classifying even terrestrial-class transits, unlike the radial velocity technique.},

abstract = {We report on the discovery and the Rossiter-McLaughlin (R-M) effect of Kepler-8b, a transiting planet identified by the NASA Kepler Mission. Kepler photometry and Keck-HIRES radial velocities yield the radius and mass of the planet around this F8IV subgiant host star. The planet has a radius R P = 1.419 RJ and a mass MP = 0.60MJ, yielding a density of 0.26 gcm-3, one of the lowest planetary densities known. The orbital period is P = 3.523 days and the orbital semimajor axis is 0.0483+0.0006-0.0012 AU. The star has a large rotational vsini of 10.5 ± 0.7 kms-1 and is relatively faint (V ≈ 13.89 mag); both properties are deleterious to precise Doppler measurements. The velocities are indeed noisy, with scatter of 30 ms -1, but exhibit a period and phase that are consistent with those implied by transit photometry. We securely detect the R-M effect, confirming the planet's existence and establishing its orbit as prograde. We measure an inclination between the projected planetary orbital axis and the projected stellar rotation axis of $\lambda$ = - 26°.4 ± 10°. 1, indicating a significant inclination of the planetary orbit. R-M measurements of a large sample of transiting planets from Kepler will provide a statistically robust measure of the true distribution of spin-orbit orientations for hot Jupiters around F and early G stars. {\textcopyright} 2010.

abstract = {Astrophysical false positives due to stellar eclipsing binaries pose one of the greatest challenges to ground-based surveys for transiting hot Jupiters. We have used known properties of multiple star systems and hot Jupiter systems to predict, a priori, the number of such false detections and the number of genuine planet detections recovered in two hypothetical but realistic ground-based transit surveys targeting fields close to the galactic plane (b ∼ 10°): a shallow survey covering a magnitude range 10 {\textless} V {\textless} 13 and a deep survey covering a magnitude range 15 {\textless} V {\textless} 19. Our results are consistent with the commonly reported experience of false detections outnumbering planet detections by a factor of 10 in shallow surveys, while in our synthetic deep survey we find 1-2 false detections for every planet detection. We characterize the eclipsing binary configurations that are most likely to cause false detections and find that they can be divided into three main types: (1) two dwarfs undergoing grazing transits, (2) two dwarfs undergoing low-latitude transits in which one component has a substantially smaller radius than the other, and (3) two eclipsing dwarfs blended with one or more physically unassociated foreground stars. We also predict that a significant fraction of hot Jupiter detections are blended with the light from other stars, showing that care must be taken to identify the presence of any unresolved neighbors in order to obtain accurate estimates of planetary radii. This issue is likely to extend to terrestrial planet candidates in the CoRoT and Kepler transit surveys, for which neighbors of much fainter relative brightness will be important. {\textcopyright} 2010.

We revisit previously published data and analyze additional Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data, finding that the source is likely on a radial trajectory and has faded and become extended. Dynamical and collisional modeling of a recently produced dust cloud yields results consistent with the observations. Fomalhaut b appears to be a directly imaged catastrophic collision between two large planetesimals in an extrasolar planetary system. Similar events should be very rare in quiescent planetary systems of the age of Fomalhaut, suggesting that we are possibly witnessing the effects of gravitational stirring due to the orbital evolution of hypothetical planet(s) around the star.},

abstract = {High-contrast adaptive optics (AO) imaging is a powerful technique to probe the architectures of planetary systems from the outside-in and survey the atmospheres of self-luminous giant planets. Direct imaging has rapidly matured over the past decade and especially the last few years with the advent of high-order AO systems, dedicated planetfinding instruments with specialized coronagraphs, and innovative observing and post-processing strategies to suppress speckle noise. This review summarizes recent progress in high-contrast imaging with particular emphasis on observational results, discoveries near and below the deuterium-burning limit, and a practical overview of largescale surveys and dedicated instruments. I conclude with a statistical meta-analysis of deep imaging surveys in the literature. Based on observations of 384 unique and single young (≈5–300 Myr) stars spanning stellar masses between 0.1 and 3.0 Me, the overall occurrence rate of 5–13 MJup companions at orbital distances of 30–300 au is 0.6-+0.5{\%}0.7 assuming hot-start evolutionary models. The most massive giant planets regularly accessible to direct imaging are about as rare as hot Jupiters are around Sun-like stars. Dividing this sample into individual stellar mass bins does not reveal any statistically significant trend in planet frequency with host mass: giant planets are found around 2.8-+2.3{\%}3.7 of BA stars, {\textless}4.1{\%} of FGK stars, and {\textless}3.9{\%} of M dwarfs. Looking forward, extreme AO systems and the next generation of ground- and space-based telescopes with smaller inner working angles and deeper detection limits will increase the pace of discovery to ultimately map the demographics, composition, evolution, and origin of planets spanning a broad range of masses and ages.},

abstract = {The Kepler mission has to date found almost 6000 planetary transit-like signals, utilizing three years of data for over 170,000 stars at extremely high photometric precision. Due to its design, contamination from eclipsing binaries, variable stars, and other transiting planets results in a significant number of these signals being false positives (FPs). This directly affects the determination of the occurrence rate of Earth-like planets in our Galaxy, as well as other planet population statistics. In order to detect as many of these FPs as possible, we perform ephemeris matching among all transiting planet, eclipsing binary, and variable star sources. We find that 685 Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs) - 12{\%} of all those analyzed - are FPs as a result of contamination, due to 409 unique parent sources. Of these, 118 have not previously been identified by other methods. We estimate that ∼35{\%} of KOIs are FPs due to contamination, when performing a first-order correction for observational bias. Comparing single-planet candidate KOIs to multi-planet candidate KOIs, we find an observed FP fraction due to contamination of 16{\%} and 2.4{\%} respectively, bolstering the existing evidence that multi-planet KOIs are significantly less likely to be FPs. We also analyze the parameter distributions of the ephemeris matches and derive a simple model for the most common type of contamination in the Kepler field. We find that the ephemeris matching technique is able to identify low signal-to-noise FPs that are difficult to identify with other vetting techniques. We expect FP KOIs to become more frequent when analyzing more quarters of Kepler data, and note that many of them will not be able to be identified based on Kepler data alone. {\textcopyright} 2014.

This brings the total number of KOIs and planet candidates to 7348 and 4175 respectively.

We discuss the performance of our planet detection algorithms, and the consistency of our vetting products. The full catalog is publicly available at the NASA Exoplanet Archive.},

abstract = {Context. In the exoplanetary era, the Kepler spacecraft is causing a revolution by discovering thousands of new planet candidates. However, a follow-up program is needed to reject false candidates and fully characterize the bona-fide exoplanets. Aims. Our main aims are to 1./detect and analyze close companions inside the typical Kepler point spread function (PSF) to study whether they are the responsible for the dimming found in Kepler light curves, 2./study the change in the stellar and planetary parameters caused by an unresolved object, 3./help validate the Kepler objects of interest (KOI) that do not have any object inside the Kepler PSF, and 4./study the multiplicity rate of planet-host candidates. Such a large sample of observed planet-host candidates allows us to derive statistics for close (visual or bounded) companions to the harboring star. Methods. We present lucky imaging observations for a total of 98 KOIs. This technique is based on the acquisition of thousands of very-short-exposure-time images. A selection and combination of a small amount of the highest quality frames provides a high resolution image with objects having a 0.1 arcsec PSF. We apply this technique to carry out observations in the Sloan i and z filters of our Kepler candidates. Results. We find blended objects inside the Kepler PSF for a significant percentage of KOIs. On the one hand, only 58.2{\%} of the hosts do not have any object within 6 arcsec. On the other hand, we find 19 companions closer than 3 arcsec in 17 KOIs. According to their magnitudes and i-z colors, 8 of them could be physically bound to the host star. {\textcopyright}2012 ESO.},

abstract = {We use the optical and near-infrared photometry from the Kepler Input Catalog to provide improved estimates of the stellar characteristics of the smallest stars in the Kepler target list. We find 3897 dwarfs with temperatures below 4000 K, including 64 planet candidate host stars orbited by 95 transiting planet candidates. We refit the transit events in the Kepler light curves for these planet candidates and combine the revised planet/star radius ratios with our improved stellar radii to revise the radii of the planet candidates orbiting the cool target stars. We then compare the number of observed planet candidates to the number of stars around which such planets could have been detected in order to estimate the planet occurrence rate around cool stars. We find that the occurrence rate of 0.5-4 R ⊕ planets with orbital periods shorter than 50 days is planets per star. The occurrence rate of Earth-size (0.5-1.4 R ⊕) planets is constant across the temperature range of our sample at Earth-size planets per star, but the occurrence of 1.4-4 R ⊕ planets decreases significantly at cooler temperatures. Our sample includes two Earth-size planet candidates in the habitable zone, allowing us to estimate that the mean number of Earth-size planets in the habitable zone is planets per cool star. Our 95{\%} confidence lower limit on the occurrence rate of Earth-size planets in the habitable zones of cool stars is 0.04 planets per star. With 95{\%} confidence, the nearest transiting Earth-size planet in the habitable zone of a cool star is within 21 pc. Moreover, the nearest non-transiting planet in the habitable zone is within 5 pc with 95{\%} confidence. {\textcopyright} 2013. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We report the distribution of planets as a function of planet radius, orbital period, and stellar effective temperature for orbital periods less than 50days around solar-type (GK) stars. These results are based on the 1235 planets (formally "planet candidates") from the Kepler mission that include a nearly complete set of detected planets as small as 2 R ⊕. For each of the 156,000 target stars, we assess the detectability of planets as a function of planet radius, R p, and orbital period, P, using a measure of the detection efficiency for each star. We also correct for the geometric probability of transit, R /a. We consider first Kepler target stars within the "solar subset" having T eff = 4100-6100K, log g = 4.0-4.9, and Kepler magnitude Kp {\textless} 15 mag, i.e., bright, main-sequence GK stars. We include only those stars having photometric noise low enough to permit detection of planets down to 2 R ⊕. We count planets in small domains of R p and P and divide by the included target stars to calculate planet occurrence in each domain. The resulting occurrence of planets varies by more than three orders of magnitude in the radius-orbital period plane and increases substantially down to the smallest radius (2 R ⊕) and out to the longest orbital period (50days, 0.25AU) in our study. For P {\textless} 50 days, the distribution of planet radii is given by a power law, df/dlog R = kRR $\alpha$ with kR = 2.9+0.5- 0.4, $\alpha$ = -1.92 ± 0.11, and R ≡ R p/R ⊕. This rapid increase in planet occurrence with decreasing planet size agrees with the prediction of core-accretion formation but disagrees with population synthesis models that predict a desert at super-Earth and Neptune sizes for close-in orbits. Planets with orbital periods shorter than 2days are extremely rare; for R p {\textgreater} 2 R ⊕ we measure an occurrence of less than 0.001 planets per star. For all planets with orbital periods less than 50days, we measure occurrence of 0.130 ± 0.008, 0.023 ± 0.003, and 0.013 ± 0.002 planets per star for planets with radii 2-4, 4-8, and 8-32 R ⊕, in agreement with Doppler surveys. We fit occurrence as a function of P to a power-law model with an exponential cutoff below a critical period P 0. For smaller planets, P 0 has larger values, suggesting that the "parking distance" for migrating planets moves outward with decreasing planet size. We also measured planet occurrence over a broader stellar T eff range of 3600-7100K, spanning M0 to F2 dwarfs. Over this range, the occurrence of 2-4 R ⊕ planets in the Kepler field increases with decreasing T eff, with these small planets being seven times more abundant around cool stars (3600-4100K) than the hottest stars in our sample (6600-7100K). {\textcopyright} {\textcopyright} 2012.

The Kepler-18 star has a mass of 0.97 M ⊙, a radius of 1.1 R ⊙, an effective temperature of 5345K, and an iron abundance of [Fe/H] = +0.19. The planets have orbital periods of approximately 3.5, 7.6, and 14.9 days. The innermost planet "b" is a "super-Earth" with a mass of 6.9 ± 3.4 M ⊕, a radius of 2.00 ± 0.10 R ⊕, and a mean density of 4.9 ± 2.4gcm3. The two outer planets "c" and "d" are both low-density Neptune-mass planets.

abstract = {Interferometric techniques o†er two advantages for the detection and analysis of thermal radiation from planets: destructive interference to strongly suppress the stellar emission, and the possibility of high-resolution imaging to resolve planets and distinguish them from dust emission. This paper presents a new interferometric conÐguration in which the con{\~{N}}icting requirements for these goals are reconciled. It realizes a very strong, broad interference null, so high-resolution fringes can be used while maintaining good suppression of the stellar disk. Complex phase measurement is precluded by the need for destruc- tive interference, but we Ðnd that a cross-correlation technique analogous to aperture synthesis can recover true images. When operated 5 AU from the Sun to escape background emission from local zodiacal dust, the interferometer{\"{I}}s sensitivity will be limited fundamentally by noise in the photon {\~{N}}ux from warm zodiacal dust in the planetary system under observation. In order to scale the interferometer for adequate sensitivity, the 10 km emission from such dust could be determined early on by a ground- based interferometer. If stars at 10 pc distance have zodiacal clouds like our own, a 50 m long space interferometer with four 1 m elements should see individual planets like the Earth in images taken over 10 hours. Simultaneous infrared spectra of planets like Earth, Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn could be obtained during a 3 month integration, with the sensitivity to detect carbon dioxide, water, and ozone at the levels seen in Earth{\"{I}}s spectrum.},

abstract = {We present an improved estimate of the occurrence rate of small planets orbiting small stars by searching the full four-year Kepler data set for transiting planets using our own planet detection pipeline and conducting transit injection and recovery simulations to empirically measure the search completeness of our pipeline. We identified 156 planet candidates, including one object that was not previously identified as a Kepler Object of Interest. We inspected all publicly available follow-up images, observing notes, and centroid analyses, and corrected for the likelihood of false positives. We evaluated the sensitivity of our detection pipeline on a star-by-star basis by injecting 2000 transit signals into the light curve of each target star. For periods shorter than 50 days, we find 0.56 -0.05+0.06 Earth-size planets (1-1.5 R⊕) and 0.46 -0.05+0.07 super-Earths (1.5-2 R⊕) per M dwarf. In total, we estimate a cumulative planet occurrence rate of 2.5 ± 0.2 planets per M dwarf with radii 1-4 R⊕ and periods shorter than 200 days. Within a conservatively defined habitable zone (HZ) based on the moist greenhouse inner limit and maximum greenhouse outer limit, we estimate an occurrence rate of 0.16 -0.07+0.17 Earth-size planets and 0.12 -0.05+0.10 super-Earths per M dwarf HZ. Adopting the broader insolation boundaries of the recent Venus and early Mars limits yields a higher estimate of 0.24 -0.08+0.18 Earth-size planets and 0.21 -0.06+0.11 super-Earths per M dwarf HZ. This suggests that the nearest potentially habitable non-transiting and transiting Earth-size planets are 2.6 ± 0.4 pc and 10.6 -1.8+1.6 pc away, respectively. If we include super-Earths, these distances diminish to 2.1 ± 0.2 pc and 8.6 -0.8+0.7 pc.},

abstract = {Over the last two decades, several thousand exoplanets have been identified, and their study has become a high scientific priority. Direct imaging of nearby exoplanets and the circumstellar disks in which they form and evolve is challenging due to the high contrast ratio and small angular separation relative to the central star. Exoplanets are typically within 1 arcsec of, and between 4 and 10 orders of magnitude fainter than, the stars they orbit. To meet these challenges, ground-based telescopes must be equipped with extreme adaptive optics (ExAO) systems optimized to acquire high-contrast images of the immediate surrounding of nearby bright stars. Current ExAO systems have the sensitivity to image thermal emission from young massive planets in near-IR, while future systems deployed on Giant Segmented Mirror Telescopes will image starlight reflected by lower-mass rocky planets. Thanks to rapid progress in optical coronagraphy, wavefront control, and data analysis techniques, direct imaging and spectroscopic characterization of habitable exoplanets will be within reach of the next generation of large ground-based telescopes.},

abstract = {Since the discovery of short-period exoplanets a decade ago, photometric surveys have been recognized as a feasible method to detect transiting hot Jupiters. Many transit surveys are now underway, with instruments ranging from 10-cm cameras to the Hubble Space Telescope. However, the results of these surveys have been much below the expected capacity, estimated in the dozens of detections per year. One of the reasons is the presence of systematics ('red noise') in photometric time-series. In general, yield predictions assume uncorrelated noise ( 'white noise'). In this paper, we show that the effect of red noise on the detection threshold and the expected yields cannot be neglected in typical ground-based surveys. We develop a simple method to determine the effect of red noise on photometric planetary transit detections. This method can be applied to determine detection thresholds for transit surveys. We show that the detection threshold in the presence of systematics can be much higher than that with the assumption of white noise, and obeys a different dependence on magnitude, orbital period and the parameters of the survey. Our method can also be used to estimate the significance level of a planetary transit candidate (to select promising candidates for spectroscopic follow-up). We apply our method to the OGLE planetary transit search, and show that it provides a reliable description of the actual detection threshold with real correlated noise. We point out in what way the presence of red noise could be at least partly responsible for the dearth of transiting planet detections from existing surveys, and examine some possible adaptations in survey planning and strategy. Finally, we estimate the photometric stability necessary to the detection of transiting 'hot Neptunes'. {\textcopyright} 2006 RAS.},

abstract = {The Kepler mission is uniquely suited to study the frequencies of extrasolar planets. This goal requires knowledge of the incidence of false positives such as eclipsing binaries in the background of the targets, or physically bound to them, which can mimic the photometric signal of a transiting planet. We perform numerical simulations of the Kepler targets and of physical companions or stars in the background to predict the occurrence of astrophysical false positives detectable by the mission. Using real noise level estimates, we compute the number and characteristics of detectable eclipsing pairs involving main-sequence stars and non-main-sequence stars or planets, and we quantify the fraction of those that would pass the Kepler candidate vetting procedure. By comparing their distribution with that of the Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs) detected during the first six quarters of operation of the spacecraft, we infer the false positive rate of Kepler and study its dependence on spectral type, candidate planet size, and orbital period. We find that the global false positive rate of Kepler is 9.4{\%}, peaking for giant planets (6-22 R ⊕) at 17.7{\%}, reaching a low of 6.7{\%} for small Neptunes (2-4 R ⊕), and increasing again for Earth-size planets (0.8-1.25 R ⊕) to 12.3{\%}. Most importantly, we also quantify and characterize the distribution and rate of occurrence of planets down to Earth size with no prior assumptions on their frequency, by subtracting from the population of actual Kepler candidates our simulated population of astrophysical false positives. We find that 16.5{\%} ± 3.6{\%} of main-sequence FGK stars have at least one planet between 0.8 and 1.25 R ⊕ with orbital periods up to 85 days. This result is a significant step toward the determination of eta-earth, the occurrence of Earth-like planets in the habitable zone of their parent stars. There is no significant dependence of the rates of planet occurrence between 0.8 and 4 Earth radii with spectral type. In the process, we also derive a prescription for the signal recovery rate of Kepler that enables a good match to both the KOI size and orbital period distribution, as well as their signal-to-noise distribution. {\textcopyright} 2013.

abstract = {Exoplanetary science is on the verge of an unprecedented revolution. The thousands of exoplanets discovered over the past decade have most recently been supplemented by discoveries of potentially habitable planets around nearby low-mass stars. Currently, the field is rapidly progressing toward detailed spectroscopic observations to characterize the atmospheres of these planets. Various surveys from space and the ground are expected to detect numerous more exoplanets orbiting nearby stars that make the planets conducive for atmospheric characterization. The current state of this frontier of exoplanetary atmospheres may be summarized as follows. □ We have entered the era of comparative exoplanetology thanks to high-fidelity atmospheric observations now available for tens of exoplanets. □ Recent studies reveal a rich diversity of chemical compositions and atmospheric processes hitherto unseen in the Solar System. □ Elemental abundances of exoplanetary atmospheres place important constraints on exoplanetary formation and migration histories. □ Upcoming observational facilities promise to revolutionize exoplanetary spectroscopy down to rocky exoplanets. □ The detection of a biosignature in an exoplanetary atmosphere is conceivable over the next decade. In the present review, we discuss the modern and future landscape of this frontier area of exoplanetary atmospheres. We start with a brief review of the area, emphasising the key insights gained from different observationalmethods and theoretical studies. This is followed by an in-depth discussion of the state of the art, challenges, and future prospects in three forefront branches of the area.},

abstract = {Close binaries suppress the formation of circumstellar (S-type) planets and therefore significantly bias the inferred planet occurrence rates and statistical trends. After compiling various radial velocity and high-resolution imaging surveys, we determine that binaries with a {\textless} 1 au fully suppress S-type planets, binaries with a = 10 au host close planets at 15{\%} the occurrence rate of single stars, and wide binaries with a {\textgreater} 200 au have a negligible effect on planet formation. We show that F = 43{\%} +/- 6{\%} of solar-type primaries do not host close planets due to suppression by close stellar companions. By removing spectroscopic binaries from their samples, radial velocity surveys for giant planets boost their detection rates by a factor of 1/(1-F) = 1.8 +/- 0.2 compared to transiting surveys. This selection bias fully accounts for the discrepancy in hot Jupiter occurrence rates inferred from these two detection methods. Correcting for both planet suppression by close binaries and transit dilution by wide binaries, the occurrence rate of small planets orbiting single G-dwarfs is 2.1 +/- 0.3 times larger than the rate inferred from all G-dwarfs in the Kepler survey. About half (but not all) of the observed increase in small, short-period planets toward low-mass hosts can be explained by the corresponding decrease in the binary fraction. Finally, we demonstrate that the apparent enhancement of wide stellar companions to hot Jupiter hosts is due to multiple selection effects. Although very close binaries with secondary masses M{\_}2 {\textgreater} 10 M{\_}J preferentially have wide tertiary companions, genuine hot Jupiters with M{\_}p = 0.2-4 M{\_}J that formed via core accretion do not exhibit a statistically significant excess of wide stellar companions.},

abstract = {We present a framework to conservatively estimate the probability that any particular planet-like transit signal observed by the Kepler mission is in fact a planet, prior to any ground-based follow-up efforts. We use Monte Carlo methods based on stellar population synthesis and Galactic structure models, and report false positive probabilities (FPPs) for every Kepler Object of Interest, assuming a 20{\%} intrinsic occurrence rate of close-in planets in the radius range 0.5 R ⊕ {\textless} Rp {\textless} 20 R ⊕. Nearly 90{\%} of the 1235 candidates have FPP {\textless}10{\%}, and over half have FPP {\textless}5{\%}. This probability varies with the magnitude and Galactic latitude of the target star, and with the depth of the transit signal - deeper signals generally have higher FPPs than shallower signals. We establish that a single deep high-resolution image will be an effective follow-up tool for the shallowest (Earth-sized) transits, providing the quickest route toward probabilistically validating the smallest candidates by potentially decreasing the FPP of an Earth-sized transit around a faint star from {\textgreater}10{\%} to {\textless}1{\%}. Since Kepler has detected many more planetary signals than can be positively confirmed with ground-based follow-up efforts in the near term, these calculations will be crucial to using the ensemble of Kepler data to determine population characteristics of planetary systems.

abstract = {Light curves from the Kepler Mission contain valuable information on the nature of the phenomena producing the transit-like signals. To assist in exploring the possibility that they are due to an astrophysical false positive, we describe a procedure (BLENDER) to model the photometry in terms of a "blend" rather than a planet orbiting a star. A blend may consist of a background or foreground eclipsing binary (or star-planet pair) whose eclipses are attenuated by the light of the candidate and possibly other stars within the photometric aperture. We apply BLENDER to the case of Kepler-9 (KIC 3323887), a target harboring two previously confirmed Saturn-size planets (Kepler-9 b and Kepler-9 c) showing transit timing variations, and an additional shallower signal with a 1.59 day period suggesting the presence of a super-Earth-size planet. Using BLENDER together with constraints from other follow-up observations we are able to rule out all blends for the two deeper signals and provide independent validation of their planetary nature. For the shallower signal, we rule out a large fraction of the false positives that might mimic the transits. The false alarm rate for remaining blends depends in part (and inversely) on the unknown frequency of small-size planets. Based on several realistic estimates of this frequency, we conclude with very high confidence that this small signal is due to a super-Earth-size planet (Kepler-9 d) in a multiple system, rather than a false positive. The radius is determined to be 1.64+0.19-0.14 R., and current spectroscopic observations are as yet insufficient to establish its mass. {\textcopyright} 2011 The American Astronomical Society.

Deriving accurate exoplanetary radii requires accurate measurements of the host star radii and the planetary transit depths, including accounting for any "third light" in the system due to nearby bound companions or background stars. High-resolution imaging of Kepler and K2 planet candidate hosts to detect very close (within {\~{}}0.5") background or bound stellar companions has been crucial for both confirming the planetary nature of candidates, and the determination of accurate planetary radii and mean densities. Here we present an investigation of the effect of close companions, both detected and undetected, on the observed (raw count) exoplanet radius distribution. We demonstrate that the recently detected "gap" in the observed radius distribution (also seen in the completeness-corrected distribution) is fairly robust to undetected stellar companions, given that all of the systems in the sample have undergone some kind of vetting with high-resolution imaging. However, while the gap in the observed sample is not erased or shifted, it is partially filled in after accounting for possible undetected stellar companions. These findings have implications for the most likely core composition, and thus formation location, of super-Earth and sub-Neptune planets. Furthermore, we show that without high-resolution imaging of planet candidate host stars, the shape of the observed exoplanet radius distribution will be incorrectly inferred, for both Kepler- and TESS-detected systems.},

abstract = {[Abridged] We have only been able to comprehensively characterize the atmospheres of a handful of transiting planets, because most orbit faint stars. TESS will discover transiting planets orbiting the brightest stars, enabling, in principle, an atmospheric survey of 10{\^{}}2 to 10{\^{}}3 bright hot Jupiters and warm sub-Neptunes. Uniform observations of such a statistically significant sample would provide leverage to understand---and learn from---the diversity of short-period planets. We argue that the best way to maximize the scientific returns of TESS is with a follow-up space mission consisting of a {\~{}}1 m telescope with an optical--NIR spectrograph: it could measure molecular absorption for non-terrestrial planets, as well as eclipses and phase variations for the hottest jovians. Such a mission could observe up to 10{\^{}}3 transits per year, thus enabling it to survey a large fraction of the bright (J{\textless}11) TESS planets. JWST could be used to perform detailed atmospheric characterization of the most interesting transiting targets (transit, eclipse, and---when possible---phase-resolved spectroscopy). TESS is also expected to discover a few temperate terrestrial planets transiting nearby M-Dwarfs. Characterizing these worlds will be time-intensive: JWST will need months to provide tantalizing constraints on the presence of an atmosphere, planetary rotational state, clouds, and greenhouse gases. Future flagship missions should be designed to provide better constraints on the habitability of M-Dwarf temperate terrestrial planets.},

abstract = {We present results of the largest, most comprehensive study ever done of the stellar multiplicity of the most common stars in the Galaxy, the red dwarfs. We have conducted an all-sky, volume-limited survey for stellar companions to 1120 M dwarf primaries known to lie within 25 pc of the Sun via trigonometric parallaxes. In addition to a comprehensive literature search, stars were explored in new surveys for companions at separations of 2" to 300". A reconnaissance of wide companions to separations of 300" was done via blinking archival images. I-band images were used to search our sample for companions at separations of 2" to 180". Various astrometric and photometric methods were used to probe the inner 2" to reveal close companions. We report the discovery of 20 new companions and identify 56 candidate multiple systems. We find a stellar multiplicity rate of 26.8 +/- 1.4{\%} and a stellar companion rate of 32.4 +/- 1.4{\%} for M dwarfs. There is a broad peak in the separation distribution of the companions at 4 -- 20 AU, with a weak trend of smaller projected linear separations for lower mass primaries. A hint that M dwarf multiplicity may be a function of tangential velocity is found, with faster moving, presumably older, stars found to be multiple somewhat less often. We calculate that stellar companions make up at least 17{\%} of mass attributed to M dwarfs in the solar neighborhood, with roughly 11{\%} of M dwarf mass hidden as unresolved companions. Finally, when considering all M dwarf primaries and companions, we find that the mass distribution for M dwarfs increases to the end of the stellar main sequence.},

We find similar occurrence rates using both a Poisson likelihood Bayesian analysis and Approximate Bayesian Computation. Our results are corrected for catalog completeness and reliability. Both completeness and the planet occurrence rate are dependent on stellar effective temperature. We also present occurrence rates for various stellar populations and planet size ranges.

abstract = {We describe the photometric calibration and stellar classification methods used by the Stellar Classification Project to produce the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC). The KIC is a catalog containing photometric and physical data for sources in the Kepler mission field of view; it is used by the mission to select optimal targets. Four of the visible-light (g, r, i, z) magnitudes used in the KIC are tied to Sloan Digital Sky Survey magnitudes; the fifth (D51) is an AB magnitude calibrated to be consistent with Castelli {\&} Kurucz (CK) model atmosphere fluxes. We derived atmospheric extinction corrections from hourly observations of secondary standard fields within the Kepler field of view. For these filters and extinction estimates, repeatability of absolute photometry for stars brighter than magnitude 15 is typically 2{\%}. We estimated stellar parameters {\{}T eff, log (g), log (Z), E B - V{\}} using Bayesian posterior probability maximization to match observed colors to CK stellar atmosphere models. We applied Bayesian priors describing the distribution of solar-neighborhood stars in the color-magnitude diagram, in log (Z), and in height above the galactic plane. Several comparisons with samples of stars classified by other means indicate that for 4500K ≤T eff ≤ 6500 K, our classifications are reliable within about 200 K and 0.4 dex in log (g) for dwarfs, with somewhat larger log (g) uncertainties for giants. It is difficult to assess the reliability of our log (Z) estimates, but there is reason to suspect that it is poor, particularly at extreme T eff. Comparisons between the CK models and observed colors are generally satisfactory with some exceptions, notably for stars cooler than 4500K. Of great importance for the Kepler mission, for T eff ≤ 5400 K, comparison with asteroseismic results shows that the distinction between main-sequence stars and giants is reliable with about 98{\%} confidence. Larger errors in log (g) occur for warmer stars, for which our filter set provides inadequate gravity diagnostics. The KIC is available through the MAST data archive. {\textcopyright} 2011.

We apply this simulator to the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS), a wide-field survey designed to detect transiting Neptune-sized exoplanets. We find that red noise is the main limitation of NGTS up to 14 mag, and that its obtained level determines the expected yield. Assuming a red noise level of 1 mmag, the simulation predicts the following for a 4-yr survey: 4 ± 3 Super-Earths, 19 ± 5 Small Neptunes, 16 ± 4 Large Neptunes, 55 ± 8 Saturn-sized planets and 150 ± 10 Jupiter-sized planets, along with 4688 ± 45 eclipsing binaries and 843 ± 75 background eclipsing binaries.

The predictions are based on Monte Carlo simulations of the nearby population of stars, occurrence rates of planets derived from Kepler, and models for the photometric performance and sky coverage of the TESS cameras. We expect that TESS will find approximately 1700 transiting planets from pre-selected target stars.

abstract = {NASA's Kepler mission has provided several thousand transiting planet candidates during the 4 yr of its nominal mission, yet only a small subset of these candidates have been confirmed as true planets. Therefore, the most fundamental question about these candidates is the fraction of bona fide planets. Estimating the rate of false positives of the overall Kepler sample is necessary to derive the planet occurrence rate. We present the results from two large observational campaigns that were conducted with the Spitzer Space Telescope during the the Kepler mission. These observations are dedicated to estimating the false positive rate (FPR) among the Kepler candidates. We select a sub-sample of 51 candidates, spanning wide ranges in stellar, orbital, and planetary parameter space, and we observe their transits with Spitzer at 4.5 $\mu$m. We use these observations to measures the candidate's transit depths and infrared magnitudes. An authentic planet produces an achromatic transit depth (neglecting the modest effect of limb darkening). Conversely a bandpass-dependent depth alerts us to the potential presence of a blending star that could be the source of the observed eclipse: a false positive scenario. For most of the candidates (85{\%}), the transit depths measured with Kepler are consistent with the transit depths measured with Spitzer as expected for planetary objects, while we find that the most discrepant measurements are due to the presence of unresolved stars that dilute the photometry. The Spitzer constraints on their own yield FPRs between 5{\%} and depending on the Kepler Objects of Interest. By considering the population of the Kepler field stars, and by combining follow-up observations (imaging) when available, we find that the overall FPR of our sample is low. The measured upper limit on the FPR of our sample is 8.8{\%} at a confidence level of 3$\sigma$. This observational result, which uses the achromatic property of planetary transit signals that is not investigated by the Kepler observations, provides an independent indication that Kepler's FPR is low.},

abstract = {Most of the exoplanets known today have been discovered by indirect techniques, based on the study of the host star radial velocity or photometric temporal variations. These detections allowed the study of the planet populations in the first 5-8AU from the central stars and have provided precious information on the way planets form and evolve at such separations. Direct imaging on 8-10m class telescopes allows the detection of giant planets at larger separations (currently typically more than 5- 10 AU) complementing the indirect techniques. So far, only a few planets have been imaged around young stars, but each of them provides an opportunity for unique dedicated studies of their orbital, physical and atmospheric properties and sometimes also on the interaction with the 'second-generation', debris discs. These few detections already challenge formation theories. In this paper, I present the results of direct imaging surveys obtained so far, and what they already tell us about giant planet (GP) formation and evolution. Individual and emblematic cases are detailed; they illustrate what future instruments will routinely deliver for a much larger number of stars. I also point out the limitations of this approach, as well as the needs for further work in terms of planet formation modelling. I finally present the progress expected in direct imaging in the near future, thanks in particular to forthcoming planet imagers on 8-10m class telescopes. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.},

abstract = {We present ground-based observations from the Discovery Channel Telescope (DCT) of three transits of Kepler-445c---a supposed super-Earth exoplanet with properties resembling GJ 1214b---and demonstrate that the transit depth is approximately 50 percent shallower than the depth previously inferred from Kepler Spacecraft data. The resulting decrease in planetary radius significantly alters the interpretation of the exoplanet's bulk composition. Despite the faintness of the M4 dwarf host star, our ground-based photometry clearly recovers each transit and achieves repeatable 1-sigma precision of approximately 0.2 percent (2 millimags). The transit parameters estimated from the DCT data are discrepant with those inferred from the Kepler data to at least 17-sigma confidence. This inconsistency is due to a subtle miscalculation of the stellar crowding metric during the Kepler pre-search data conditioning (PDC). The crowding metric, or CROWDSAP, is contaminated by a non-existent "phantom star" originating in the USNO-B1 catalog and inherited by the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC). Phantom stars in the KIC are likely rare, but they have the potential to affect statistical studies of Kepler targets that use the PDC transit depths for a large number of exoplanets where individual follow-up observation of each is not possible. The miscalculation of Kepler-445c's transit depth emphasizes the importance of stellar crowding in the Kepler data, and provides a cautionary tale for the analysis of data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which will have even larger pixels than Kepler.},

abstract = {The Kepler mission has discovered more than 2500 exoplanet candidates in the first two years of spacecraft data, with approximately 40{\%} of those in candidate multi-planet systems. The high rate of multiplicity combined with the low rate of identified false positives indicates that the multiplanet systems contain very few false positive signals due to other systems not gravitationally bound to the target star. False positives in the multi-planet systems are identified and removed, leaving behind a residual population of candidate multi-planet transiting systems expected to have a false positive rate less than 1{\%}. We present a sample of 340 planetary systems that contain 851 planets that are validated to substantially better than the 99{\%} confidence level; the vast majority of these have not been previously verified as planets. We expect ∼two unidentified false positives making our sample of planet very reliable. We present fundamental planetary properties of our sample based on a comprehensive analysis of Kepler light curves, ground-based spectroscopy, and high-resolution imaging. Since we do not require spectroscopy or high-resolution imaging for validation, some of our derived parameters for a planetary system may be systematically incorrect due to dilution from light due to additional stars in the photometric aperture. Nonetheless, our result nearly doubles the number verified exoplanets. {\textcopyright} 2014. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) will be conducting a nearly all-sky photometric survey over two years, with a core mission goal to discover small transiting exoplanets orbiting nearby bright stars. It will obtain 30-minute cadence observations of all objects in the TESS fields of view, along with 2-minute cadence observations of 200,000 to 400,000 selected stars. The choice of which stars to observe at the 2-min cadence is driven by the need to detect small transiting planets, which leads to the selection of primarily bright, cool dwarfs. We describe the catalogs assembled and the algorithms used to populate the TESS Input Catalog (TIC). We also describe a ranking system for prioritizing stars according to the smallest transiting planet detectable, and assemble a Candidate Target List (CTL) using that ranking. We discuss additional factors that affect the ability to photometrically detect and dynamically confirm small planets, and we note additional stellar populations of interest that may be added to the final target list. The TIC is available on the STScI MAST server, and an enhanced CTL is available through the Filtergraph data visualization portal system at the URL https://filtergraph.vanderbilt.edu/tess{\_}ctl .},

abstract = {Low-frequency ($\nu$ ≲ 150 MHz) stellar radio emission is expected to originate in the outer corona at heights comparable to and larger than the stellar radius. Such emission from the Sun has been used to study coronal structure, mass ejections and space-weather conditions around the planets1. Searches for low-frequency emission from other stars have detected only a single active flare star2 that is not representative of the wider stellar population. Here we report the detection of low-frequency radio emission from a quiescent star, GJ 1151—a member of the most common stellar type (red dwarf or spectral class M) in the Galaxy. The characteristics of the emission are similar to those of planetary auroral emissions3 (for example, Jupiter's decametric emission), suggesting a coronal structure dominated by a global magnetosphere with low plasma density. Our results show that large-scale currents that power radio aurorae operate over a vast range of mass and atmospheric composition, ranging from terrestrial planets to main-sequence stars. The Poynting flux required to produce the observed radio emission cannot be generated by GJ 1151's slow rotation, but can originate in a sub-Alfv{\'{e}}nic interaction of its magnetospheric plasma with a short-period exoplanet. The emission properties are consistent with theoretical expectations4–7 for interaction with an Earth-size planet in an approximately one- to five-day-long orbit.},

abstract = {Context. The TESS and PLATO missions are expected to find vast numbers of new transiting planet candidates. However, only a fraction of these candidates will be legitimate planets, and the candidate validation will require a significant amount of follow-up resources. Radial velocity (RV) follow-up study can be carried out only for the most promising candidates around bright, slowly rotating, stars. Thus, before devoting RV resources to candidates, they need to be vetted using cheaper methods, and, in the cases for which an RV confirmation is not feasible, the candidate's true nature needs to be determined based on these alternative methods alone. Aims. We study the applicability of multicolour transit photometry in the validation of transiting planet candidates when the candidate signal arises from a real astrophysical source (transiting planet, eclipsing binary, etc.), and not from an instrumental artefact. Particularly, we aim to answer how securely we can estimate the true uncontaminated star-planet radius ratio when the light curve may contain contamination from unresolved light sources inside the photometry aperture when combining multicolour transit observations with a physics-based contamination model in a Bayesian parameter estimation setting. More generally, we study how the contamination level, colour differences between the planet host and contaminant stars, transit signal-to-noise ratio, and available prior information affect the contamination and true radius ratio estimates. Methods. The study is based on simulations and ground-based multicolour transit observations. The contamination analyses were carried out with a contamination model integrated into the PYTRANSIT v2 transit modelling package, and the observations were carried out with the MuSCAT2 multicolour imager installed in the 1.5 m Telescopio Carlos Sanchez in the Teide Observatory, in Tenerife. Results. We show that multicolour transit photometry can be used to estimate the amount of flux contamination and the true radius ratio. Combining the true radius ratio with an estimate for the stellar radius yields the true absolute radius of the transiting object, which is a valuable quantity in statistical candidate validation, and enough in itself to validate a candidate whose radius falls below the theoretical lower limit for a brown dwarf.},

Part of the data were obtained under the Kepler imaging follow-up observation program over seven years (2009 - 2015). Almost 90{\%} of stars that are hosts to planet candidates or confirmed planets were observed. We combine measurements of companions to KOI host stars from different bands to create a comprehensive catalog of projected separations, position angles, and magnitude differences for all detected companion stars (some of which may not be bound).

The true fraction of systems with close ({\textless} {\~{}}4") companions is larger than the observed one due to the limited sensitivities of the imaging data. We derive correction factors for planet radii caused by the dilution of the transit depth: assuming that planets orbit the primary stars or the brightest companion stars, the average correction factors are 1.06 and 3.09, respectively. The true effect of transit dilution lies in between these two cases and varies with each system. Applying these factors to planet radii decreases the number of KOI planets with radii smaller than 2 R{\_}Earth by {\~{}}2-23{\%} and thus affects planet occurrence rates. This effect will also be important for the yield of small planets from future transit missions such as TESS.},

abstract = {We measure the mass of a modestly irradiated giant planet, KOI-94d. We wish to determine whether this planet, which is in a 22 day orbit and receives 2700 times as much incident flux as Jupiter, is as dense as Jupiter or rarefied like inflated hot Jupiters. KOI-94 also hosts at least three smaller transiting planets, all of which were detected by the Kepler mission. With 26 radial velocities of KOI-94 from the W. M. Keck Observatory and a simultaneous fit to the Kepler light curve, we measure the mass of the giant planet and determine that it is not inflated. Support for the planetary interpretation of the other three candidates comes from gravitational interactions through transit timing variations, the statistical robustness of multi-planet systems against false positives, and several lines of evidence that no other star resides within the photometric aperture. We report the properties of KOI-94b (MP = 10.5 ± 4.6 M⊕, RP = 1.71 ± 0.16 R ⊕, P = 3.74 days), KOI-94c (MP = M ⊕, RP = 4.32 ± 0.41 R⊕, P = 10.4 days), KOI-94d (MP = 106 ± 11 M⊕, R P = 11.27 ± 1.06 R⊕, P = 22.3 days), and KOI-94e (MP = M⊕, RP = 6.56 ± 0.62 R⊕, P = 54.3 days). The radial velocity analyses of KOI-94b and KOI-94e offer marginal ({\textgreater}2$\sigma$) mass detections, whereas the observations of KOI-94c offer only an upper limit to its mass. Using the KOI-94 system and other planets with published values for both mass and radius (138 exoplanets total, including 35 with MP {\textless} 150 M⊕), we establish two fundamental planes for exoplanets that relate their mass, incident flux, and radius from a few Earth masses up to 13 Jupiter masses: (R⊕P/R⊕) = 1.78(MP /M ⊕)0.53(F/erg s-1 cm-2) -0.03 for MP {\textless} 150 M⊕, and R ⊕P/R⊕ = 2.45(MP /M ⊕)-0.039(F/erg s-1 cm-2) 0.094 for MP {\textgreater} 150 M⊕.

abstract = {The Kepler mission provides an exciting opportunity to study the light curves of stars with unprecedented precision and continuity of coverage. This is the first look at a large sample of stars with photometric data of a quality that has heretofore been only available for our Sun. It provides the first opportunity to compare the irradiance variations of our Sun to a large cohort of stars ranging from very similar to rather different stellar properties, at a wide variety of ages. Although Kepler data are in an early phase of maturity, and we only analyze the first month of coverage, it is sufficient to garner the first meaningful measurements of our Sun's variability in the context of a large cohort of main-sequence stars in the solar neighborhood. We find that nearly half of the full sample is more active than the active Sun, although most of them are not more than twice as active. The active fraction is closer to a third for the stars most similar to the Sun, and rises to well more than half for stars cooler than mid-K spectral types. {\textcopyright} 2010.

abstract = {We have used asteroseismology to determine fundamental properties for 66 Kepler planet-candidate host stars, with typical uncertainties of 3{\%} and 7{\%} in radius and mass, respectively. The results include new asteroseismic solutions for four host stars with confirmed planets (Kepler-4, Kepler-14, Kepler-23 and Kepler-25) and increase the total number of Kepler host stars with asteroseismic solutions to 77. A comparison with stellar properties in the planet-candidate catalog by Batalha et al. shows that radii for subgiants and giants obtained from spectroscopic follow-up are systematically too low by up to a factor of 1.5, while the properties for unevolved stars are in good agreement. We furthermore apply asteroseismology to confirm that a large majority of cool main-sequence hosts are indeed dwarfs and not misclassified giants. Using the revised stellar properties, we recalculate the radii for 107 planet candidates in our sample, and comment on candidates for which the radii change from a previously giant-planet/brown-dwarf/stellar regime to a sub-Jupiter size or vice versa. A comparison of stellar densities from asteroseismology with densities derived from transit models in Batalha et al. assuming circular orbits shows significant disagreement for more than half of the sample due to systematics in the modeled impact parameters or due to planet candidates that may be in eccentric orbits. Finally, we investigate tentative correlations between host-star masses and planet-candidate radii, orbital periods, and multiplicity, but caution that these results may be influenced by the small sample size and detection biases. {\textcopyright} 2013.

We show that this statistical framework correctly estimates the abundance of false positives already identified around Kepler targets with multiple sets of transit-like signatures based on their abundance around targets with single sets of transit-like signatures. We estimate the number of multis that represent split systems of one or more planets orbiting each component of a binary star system. We use the high reliability rate for multis to validate more than one dozen particularly interesting multi-planet systems herein. Hundreds of additional multi-planet systems are validated in a companion paper by Rowe et al. We note that few very short period (P {\textless} 1.6 days) planets orbit within multiple transiting planet systems and discuss possible reasons for their absence.

abstract = {Ground-based wide-field surveys for nearby transiting gas giants are yielding far fewer true planets than astrophysical false positives, of which some are difficult to reject. Recent experience has highlighted the need for careful analysis to eliminate astronomical systems where light from a faint eclipsing binary is blended with that from a bright star. During the course of the Trans-atlantic Exoplanet Survey, we identified a system presenting a transit-like periodic signal. We obtained the proper motion and infrared color of this target (GSC 03885-00829) from publicly available catalogs, which suggested this star is an F dwarf, supporting our transit hypothesis. This spectral classification was confirmed using spectroscopic observations from which we determined the stellar radial velocity. The star did not exhibit any signs of a stellar mass companion. However, subsequent multi-color photometry displayed a color-dependent transit depth, indicating that a blend was the likely source of the eclipse. We successfully modeled our initial photometric observations of GSC 03885-00829 as the light from a K dwarf binary system superimposed on the light from a late F dwarf star. High-dispersion spectroscopy confirmed the presence of light from a cool stellar photosphere in the spectrum of this system. With this candidate, we demonstrate both the difficulty in identifying certain types of false positives in a list of candidate transiting planets and our procedure for rejecting these imposters, which may be useful to other groups performing wide-field transit surveys.},

abstract = {The detection and characterization of the first transiting super-Earth, CoRoT-7b, has required an unprecedented effort in terms of telescope time and analysis. Although the star does display a radial-velocity signal at the period of the planet, this has been difficult to disentangle from the intrinsic stellar variability and pinning down the velocity amplitude has been very challenging. As a result, the precise value of the mass of the planet - and even the extent to which it can be considered to be confirmed - has been debated in the recent literature, with six mass measurements published so far based on the same spectroscopic observations, ranging from about 2 to 8 Earth masses. Here we report on an independent validation of the planet discovery using one of the fundamental properties of a transit signal: its achromaticity. We observed four transits of CoRoT-7b at 4.5$\mu$m and 8.0$\mu$m with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) on board the Spitzer Space Telescope in order to determine whether the depth of the transit signal in the near-infrared is consistent with that observed in the CoRoT bandpass, as expected for a planet. We detected the transit and found an average depth of 0.426± 0.115mmag at 4.5$\mu$m, which is in good agreement with the depth of 0.350 ± 0.011mmag (ignoring limb darkening) found by CoRoT. The observations at 8.0$\mu$m did not yield a significant detection. The 4.5$\mu$m observations place important constraints on the kinds of astrophysical false positives that could mimic the signal. Combining this with additional constraints reported earlier, we performed an exhaustive exploration of possible blend scenarios for CoRoT-7b using the BLENDER technique. We are able to rule out the vast majority of false positives, and the remaining ones are found to be much less likely than a true transiting planet. We thus validate CoRoT-7b as a bona fide planet with a very high degree of confidence, independently of any radial-velocity information. Our Spitzer observations have additionally allowed us to significantly improve the ephemeris of the planet, so that future transits should be recoverable well into the next decade. In its warm phase Spitzer is expected to be an essential tool for the validation, along the lines of the present analysis, of transiting planet candidates with shallow signals from CoRoT as well as from the Kepler mission, including potentially rocky planets in the habitable zones of their parent stars. {\textcopyright} 2012.

These estimates are then used to size the ground-based follow-up observing efforts needed to confirm and characterize the planets. We estimate that the needed observing resources will be about 1400 telescope-nights of imaging with 0.5m to 1m-class telescopes, 300 telescope-nights with 1m to 2m-class telescopes for the classification of the host stars and for radial velocity measurements with roughly 1 km/s precision, and 380 telescope-nights with 2m to 4m-class telescopes for radial velocity studies with precision of a few m/s. Follow-up spectroscopy of the smallest planets discovered by TESS at the best possible velocity precision will be limited by the number of telescope nights available on 4m to 10m class telescopes with instruments such as HARPS and HIRES, but the pay-off of such efforts will be the determination of masses for Super Earths with sufficient accuracy to distinguish rocky desert planets from water worlds.},

abstract = {Binary stars are the main source of fundamental data on stellar masses and radii (M, R). Considerable progress has been made in recent years in the quality and quantity of such data, and stellar masses and radii of high accuracy have led to a number of qualitatively new and interesting results on the properties and evolution of normal stars. This paper reviews the current status of fundamental M and R determinations which (i) have errors ≤ 2{\%}, the limit for non-trivial results in many applications, and (ii) can be presumed valid for single stars. These two conditions limit the discussion to data from detached, doublelined eclipsing binary systems. After a brief discussion (Sect. 2) of the main tests for accuracy and consistency which must be met for observational data to be included in the sample, data for 45 binary systems (90 single stars) are presented in Sect. 3 (Table 1 and Figs. 2-5). Spectral types are O8-M1 on the main sequence, with only two stars clearly in the red-giant region. From the review by Popper (1980), data for only 6 systems survive unchanged in the present list, while improved data are given for 18 systems; 21 systems are new additions. Broadband colours, effective temperatures, and luminosities are also given, but are scale-dependent and considerably less reliably determined than M and R. The observed ranges in M and R for a given colour far exceed the observational errors, primarily due to evolutionary effects within the main sequence. For this reason, single-parameter relations used to predict M and R for single stars are limited to an accuracy of some ±15{\%} in M and ±50{\%} in R, basically independent of the number and accuracy of the data used to establish the relations. Two-parameter calibrations are discussed (Sect. 4) which can eventually reduce these errors to {\&} 5{\%} in both M and R. At this level, abundance effects become significant and presumably account for the residual scatter. Comparison of the data with stellar evolution models is the topic of Sect. 5. Characteristic features of the data which are crucial in such work are emphasized, rather than attempts to "prove" the validity of any particular set of models. Already from M and R alone, some significant constraints can be derived (Fig. 4). When both M, R, and Te are known, the initial helium abundance Y can be estimated if the metal-abundance parameter Z is assumed or determined. Studies in which binaries with accurate values of M, R, and Z are fit by models calculated for the precise observed masses, and with Y and mixing length constrained to solar values, provide the most stringent tests of the models. Probing further model refinements such as convective overshooting requires full use of the potential of the data. For example, models may yield general main-sequence limits which are consistent with the observations, but still be unable to fit any single system to the precision of the data. Conditions for critical, informative tests are discussed. Tidal effects in binaries are briefly discussed in Sect. 6. As tidal forces are extremely sensitive to the dimensions and internal structure of the stars, the present sample is well suited for such studies. Recent success in matching computed and observed apsidal-motion parameters for early-type binaries is mentioned. Finally, main priorities for future work are outlined. {\textcopyright} 1991 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {TESS is finding transiting planet candidates around bright, nearby stars across the entire sky. The large field-of-view, however, results in low spatial resolution, therefore multiple stars contribute to almost every TESS light curve. High-angular resolution imaging can detect the previously unknown companions to planetary candidate hosts that dilute the transit depths, lead to host star ambiguity, and in some cases are the source of false-positive transit signals. We use speckle imaging on SOAR to search for companions to 542 TESS planet candidate hosts in the Southern sky. We provide correction factors for the 117 systems with resolved companions due to photometric contamination. The contamination in TESS due to close binaries is similar to that found in surveys of Kepler planet candidates. For the solar-type population, we find a deep deficit of close binary systems with projected stellar separations less than 100 AU among planet candidate hosts (44 observed binaries compared to 124 expected based on field binary statistics). The close binary suppression among TESS planet candidate hosts is similar to that seen for the more distant Kepler population. We also find a large surplus of the TESS planet candidates in wide binary systems, detected in both SOAR and Gaia DR2 (119 observed binaries compared to 77 expected). These wide binaries host almost exclusively giant planets, however, suggesting orbital migration, caused by perturbations from the stellar companion, may lead to planet-planet scattering and suppress the population of small planets in wide binaries. Both trends are also apparent in the M-dwarf planet candidate hosts.},

In order to provide reliable stellar parameters in a homogeneous way, the LAMOST telescope began to carry out low-resolution spectroscopic observations for as many stars as possible in the {\$}Kepler{\$} field in 2012. By September 2018, 238,386 low-resolution spectra with SNR{\$}{\_}g \backslashgeq 6{\$} had been collected for 155,623 stars in the {\$}Kepler{\$} field, enabling the determination of atmospheric parameters and radial velocities, as well as spectral classification of the target stars. This information has been used by astronomers to carry out research in various fields, including stellar pulsations and asteroseismology, exoplanets, stellar magnetic activity and flares, peculiar stars and the Milky Way, binary stars, etc. We summarize the research progress in these fields where the usage of data from the LAMOST-{\$}Kepler{\$} (LK) project has played a role. In addition, time-domain medium-resolution spectroscopic observations have been carried out for about 12,000 stars in four central plates of the {\$}Kepler{\$} field since 2018. The currently available results show that the LAMOST-{\$}Kepler{\$} medium resolution (LK-MRS) observations provide qualified data suitable for research in additional science projects including binaries, high-amplitude pulsating stars, etc. As LAMOST is continuing to collect both low- and medium-resolution spectra of stars in the {\$}Kepler{\$} field, we expect more data to be released continuously and new scientific results to appear based on the LK project data.},

As a result, new systems have been added, additional false positives have been removed, ephemerides and principal parameters have been recomputed, classifications have been revised to rely on analytical models, and eclipse timing variations have been computed for each system. We identify several classes of systems including those that exhibit tertiary eclipse events, systems that show clear evidence of additional bodies, heartbeat systems, systems with changing eclipse depths, and systems exhibiting only one eclipse event over the duration of the mission. We have updated the period and galactic latitude distribution diagrams and included a catalog completeness evaluation.

abstract = {We present a re-analysis of the Geneva-Copenhagen survey, which benefits from the infrared flux method to improve the accuracy of the derived stellar effective temperatures and uses the latter to build a consistent and improved metallicity scale. Metallicities are calibrated on high-resolution spectroscopy and checked against four open clusters and a moving group, showing excellent consistency. The new temperature and metallicity scales provide a better match to theoretical isochrones, which are used for a Bayesian analysis of stellar ages. With respect to previous analyses, our stars are on average 100 K hotter and 0.1 dex more metal rich, which shift the peak of the metallicity distribution function around the solar value. From Str{\"{o}}mgren photometry we are able to derive for the first time a proxy for [$\alpha$/Fe] abundances, which enables us to perform a tentative dissection of the chemical thin and thick disc. We find evidence for the latter being composed of an old, mildly but systematically alpha-enhanced population that extends to super solar metallicities, in agreement with spectroscopic studies. Our revision offers the largest existing kinematically unbiased sample of the solar neighbourhood that contains full information on kinematics, metallicities, and ages and thus provides better constraints on the physical processes relevant in the build-up of the Milky Way disc, enabling a better understanding of the Sun in a Galactic context. {\textcopyright} 2011 ESO.},

Here, we present observations that provide evidence supporting a planetary nature for Kepler Object of Interest (KOI) 439.01 and KOI 732.01, and we find that KOI 531.01, a 6 R⊕ planet candidate around an M dwarf, is likely a false positive. We also present a discussion of the purported 'sub-Jovian desert' in the orbital period-planet radius plane, which cannot be easily explained by observational bias. Both KOI 439.01 and KOI 732.01 are likely planets located within the so-called desert and should be investigated with further follow-up observations. As only {\~{}}30 of the {\~{}}3600 currently active Kepler planet candidates are located within the sub-Jovian desert, it will be interesting to see if these candidates also survive the vetting process and fill in the gap in the period-radius plane.

abstract = {Probing the connection between a star's metallicity and the presence and properties of any associated planets offers an observational link between conditions during the epoch of planet formation and mature planetary systems. We explore this connection by analyzing the metallicities of Kepler target stars and the subset of stars found to host transiting planets. After correcting for survey incompleteness, we measure planet occurrence: the number of planets per 100 stars with a given metallicity {\$}M{\$}. Planet occurrence correlates with metallicity for some, but not all, planet sizes and orbital periods. For warm super-Earths having {\$}P = 10-100{\$} days and {\$}R{\_}P = 1.0-1.7{\~{}}R{\_}E{\$}, planet occurrence is nearly constant over metallicities spanning {\$}-{\$}0.4 dex to +0.4 dex. We find 20 warm super-Earths per 100 stars, regardless of metallicity. In contrast, the occurrence of warm sub-Neptunes ({\$}R{\_}P = 1.7-4.0{\~{}}R{\_}E{\$}) doubles over that same metallicity interval, from 20 to 40 planets per 100 stars. We model the distribution of planets as {\$}d f \backslashpropto 10{\^{}}{\{}\backslashbeta M{\}} d M{\$}, where {\$}\backslashbeta{\$} characterizes the strength of any metallicity correlation. This correlation steepens with decreasing orbital period and increasing planet size. For warm super-Earths {\$}\backslashbeta = -0.3{\^{}}{\{}+0.2{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.2{\}}{\$}, while for hot Jupiters {\$}\backslashbeta = +3.4{\^{}}{\{}+0.9{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.8{\}}{\$}. High metallicities in protoplanetary disks may increase the mass of the largest rocky cores or the speed at which they are assembled, enhancing the production of planets larger than 1.7 {\$}R{\_}E{\$}. The association between high metallicity and short-period planets may reflect disk density profiles that facilitate the inward migration of solids or higher rates of planet-planet scattering.},

In this paper, we present the results from the 2012 observing season, searching for stars close to 715 Kepler planet candidate hosts. We find 53 companions, 43 of which are new discoveries. We detail the Robo-AO survey data reduction methods including a method of using the large ensemble of target observations as mutual point-spread-function references, along with a new automated companion-detection algorithm designed for large adaptive optics surveys. Our survey is sensitive to objects from ≈0.″15 to 2.″5 separation, with magnitude differences up to $\Delta$m ≈ 6. We measure an overall nearby-star probability for Kepler planet candidates of 7.4{\%} ± 1.0{\%}, and calculate the effects of each detected nearby star on the Kepler-measured planetary radius. We discuss several Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs) of particular interest, including KOI-191 and KOI-1151, which are both multi-planet systems with detected stellar companions whose unusual planetary system architecture might be best explained if they are "coincident multiple" systems, with several transiting planets shared between the two stars.

abstract = {We use the Robo-AO survey of Kepler planetary candidate host stars, the largest adaptive optics survey yet performed, to measure the recovery rate of close stellar binaries in Gaia DR2. We find that Gaia recovers binaries down to 1" at magnitude contrasts as large as 6; closer systems are not resolved, regardless of secondary brightness. Gaia DR2 binary detection does not have a strong dependence on the orientation of the stellar pairs. We find 177 nearby stars to Kepler planetary candidate host stars in Gaia DR2 that were not detected in the Robo-AO survey, almost all of which are faint (G{\textgreater}20); the remainder were largely targets observed by Robo-AO in poor conditions. If the primary star is the host, the impact on the radii estimates of planet candidates in these systems is likely minimal; many of these faint stars, however, could be faint eclipsing binaries that are the source of a false positive planetary transit signal. With Robo-AO and Gaia combined, we find that 18.7{\%} of Kepler planet candidate hosts have nearby stars within 4". We also find 36 nearby stars in Gaia DR2 around 35 planetary candidate host stars detected with K2. The nearby star fraction rate for K2 planetary candidates is significantly lower than that for the primary Kepler mission. The binary recovery rate of Gaia will improve initial radius estimates of future TESS planet candidates significantly, however ground-based high-resolution follow-up observations are still needed for precise characterization and confirmation. The sensitivity of Gaia to closely separated binaries is expected to improve in later data releases.},

We discuss the photometric precision achieved on timescales relevant to transit detection for data obtained in the 33.5 day long Quarter 1 (Q1) observations that ended 2009 June 15. The lower envelope of the photometric precision obtained at various timescales is consistent with expected random noise sources, indicating that Kepler has the capability to fulfill its mission. The Kepler light curves exhibit high precision over a large dynamic range, which will surely permit their use for a large variety of investigations in addition to finding and characterizing planets.

abstract = {The Kepler mission has discovered more than 2500 exoplanet candidates in the first two years of spacecraft data, with approximately 40{\%} of those in candidate multi-planet systems. The high rate of multiplicity combined with the low rate of identified false positives indicates that the multiplanet systems contain very few false positive signals due to other systems not gravitationally bound to the target star. False positives in the multi-planet systems are identified and removed, leaving behind a residual population of candidate multi-planet transiting systems expected to have a false positive rate less than 1{\%}. We present a sample of 340 planetary systems that contain 851 planets that are validated to substantially better than the 99{\%} confidence level; the vast majority of these have not been previously verified as planets. We expect ∼two unidentified false positives making our sample of planet very reliable. We present fundamental planetary properties of our sample based on a comprehensive analysis of Kepler light curves, ground-based spectroscopy, and high-resolution imaging. Since we do not require spectroscopy or high-resolution imaging for validation, some of our derived parameters for a planetary system may be systematically incorrect due to dilution from light due to additional stars in the photometric aperture.

abstract = {One of the primary goals of exoplanet science is to find and characterize habitable planets, and direct imaging will play a key role in this effort. Though imaging a true Earth analog is likely out of reach from the ground, the coming generation of giant telescopes will find and characterize many planets in and near the habitable zones (HZs) of nearby stars. Radial velocity and transit searches indicate that such planets are common, but imaging them will require achieving extreme contrasts at very small angular separations, posing many challenges for adaptive optics (AO) system design. Giant planets in the HZ may even be within reach with the latest generation of high-contrast imagers for a handful of very nearby stars. Here we will review the definition of the HZ, and the characteristics of detectable planets there. We then review some of the ways that direct imaging in the HZ will be different from the typical exoplanet imaging survey today. Finally, we present preliminary results from our observations of the HZ of {\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} Centauri A with the Magellan AO system's VisAO and Clio2 cameras.},

abstract = {Aims. We announce confirmation of Kepler-418b, one of two proposed planets in this system. This is the first confirmation of an exoplanet based primarily on the transit color signature technique. Methods. We used the Kepler public data archive combined with multicolor photometry from the Gran Telescopio de Canarias and radial velocity follow-up using FIES at the Nordic Optical Telescope for confirmation. Results. We report a confident detection of a transit color signature that can only be explained by a compact occulting body, entirely ruling out a contaminating eclipsing binary, a hierarchical triple, or a grazing eclipsing binary. Those findings are corroborated by our radial velocity measurements, which put an upper limit of ∼1 MJup on the mass of Kepler-418b. We also report that the host star is significantly blended, confirming the ∼10{\%} light contamination suspected from the crowding metric in the Kepler light curve measured by the Kepler team. We report detection of an unresolved light source that contributes an additional ∼30{\%} to the target star, which would not have been detected without multicolor photometric analysis. The resulting planet-star radius ratio is 0.110 ± 0.0025, more than 25{\%} more than the 0.087 measured by Kepler leading to a radius of 1.20 ± 0.16 RJup instead of the 0.94 RJup measured by the Kepler team. Conclusions. This is the first confirmation of an exoplanet candidate based primarily on the transit color signature, demonstrating that this technique is viable from ground for giant planets. It is particularly useful for planets with long periods such as Kepler-418b, which tend to have long transit durations. While this technique is limited to candidates with deep transits from the ground, it may be possible to confirm earth-like exoplanet candidates with a few hours of observing time with an instrument like the James Webb Space Telescope. Additionally, multicolor photometric analysis of transits can reveal unknown stellar neighbors and binary companions that do not affect the classification of the transiting object but can have a very significant effect on the perceived planetary radius. {\textcopyright} 2014 ESO.},

abstract = {We analyze 8 years of precise radial velocity measurements from the Keck Planet Search, characterizing the detection threshold, selection effects, and completeness of the survey. We carry out a systematic search for planets by assessing the false alarm probability associated with Keplerian orbit fits to the data. This allows us to understand the detection threshold for each star in terms of the number and time baseline of the observations, and size of measurement errors and stellar jitter. We show that all planets with orbital periods {\textless}2000 days, velocity amplitudes {\textgreater}20 m/s, and eccentricities {\textless}0.6 have been announced, and summarize the candidates at lower amplitudes and longer orbital periods. For the remaining stars, we calculate upper limits on the velocity amplitude of a companion, typically 10 m/s, and use the non-detections to derive completeness corrections at low amplitudes and long orbital periods. We give the fraction of stars with a planet as a function of planet mass and orbital period, and extrapolate to long period orbits and low planet masses. A power law fit for planet masses {\textgreater}0.3 Jupiter masses and periods {\textless}2000 days gives a mass-period distribution dN=C M{\^{}}$\backslash$alpha P{\^{}}$\backslash$beta dlnM dlnP with $\backslash$alpha=-0.31 $\backslash$pm 0.2, $\backslash$beta=0.26$\backslash$pm 0.1, and the normalization constant C such that 10.5{\%} of solar type stars have a planet with mass in the range 0.3-10 Jupiter masses and orbital period 2-2000 days. The orbital period distribution shows an increase in the planet fraction by a factor of 5 for orbital periods beyond 300 days. Extrapolation gives 17-20{\%} of stars having gas giant planets within 20 AU. Finally, taking into account differences in detectability, we find that M dwarfs are 3 to 10 times less likely to harbor a Jupiter mass planet than solar type stars.},

abstract = {The false-positive probability (FPP) of Kepler transiting candidates is a key value for statistical studies of candidate properties. A previous investigation of the stellar population in the Kepler field has provided an estimate for the FPP of less than 5{\%} for most of the candidates. We report here the results of our radial velocity observations on a sample of 46 Kepler candidates with a transit depth greater than 0.4{\%}, orbital period less than 25 days and host star brighter than Kepler magnitude 14.7. We used the SOPHIE spec-trograph mounted on the 1.93-m telescope at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence to establish the nature of the transiting candidates. In this sample, we found five undiluted eclipsing binaries, two brown dwarfs, six diluted eclipsing binaries, and nine new transiting planets that complement the 11 already published planets. The remaining 13 candidates were not followed-up or remain unsolved due to photon noise limitation or lack of observations. From these results we computed the FPP for Kepler close-in giant candidates to be 34.8{\%} ± 6.5{\%}. We aimed to investigate the variation of the FPP for giant candidates with the longer orbital periods and found that it should be constant for orbital periods between 10 and 200 days. This significantly disagrees with the previous estimates. We discuss the reasons for this discrepancy and the possible extension of this work toward smaller planet candidates. Finally, taking the false-positive rate into account, we refined the occurrence rate of hot Jupiters from the Kepler data.},

Our program observed 22 Kepler Object of Interest (KOI) host stars, several of which were found to be multiple star systems unresolved by Kepler. We use our high-resolution imaging to spatially resolve the stellar multiplicity of Kepler-296, KOI-2626, and KOI-3049, and develop a conversion to the Kepler photometry (Kp) from the F555W and F775W filters on WFC3/UVIS. The binary system Kepler-296 (five planets) has a projected separation of 0.″217 (80 AU); KOI-2626 (one planet candidate) is a triple star system with a projected separation of 0.″201 (70 AU) between the primary and secondary components and 0.″161 (55 AU) between the primary and tertiary; and the binary system KOI-3049 (one planet candidate) has a projected separation of 0.″464 (225 AU). We use our measured photometry to fit the separated stellar components to the latest Victoria-Regina Stellar Models with synthetic photometry to conclude that the systems are coeval. The components of the three systems range from mid-K dwarf to mid-M dwarf spectral types.We solved for the planetary properties of each system analytically and via an MCMC algorithm using our independent stellar parameters. The planets range from ∼1.6 to 4.2 R⊕ mostly Super Earths and mini-Neptunes. As a result of the stellar multiplicity, some planets previously in the Habitable Zone are, in fact, not, and other planets may be habitable depending on their assumed stellar host.},

abstract = {New transiting planet candidates are identified in 16 months (2009 May-2010 September) of data from the Kepler spacecraft. Nearly 5000 periodic transit-like signals are vetted against astrophysical and instrumental false positives yielding 1108 viable new planet candidates, bringing the total count up to over 2300. Improved vetting metrics are employed, contributing to higher catalog reliability. Most notable is the noise-weighted robust averaging of multi-quarter photo-center offsets derived from difference image analysis that identifies likely background eclipsing binaries. Twenty-two months of photometry are used for the purpose of characterizing each of the candidates. Ephemerides (transit epoch, T 0, and orbital period, P) are tabulated as well as the products of light curve modeling: reduced radius (R P/R*), reduced semimajor axis (d/R *), and impact parameter (b). The largest fractional increases are seen for the smallest planet candidates (201{\%} for candidates smaller than 2 R⊕ compared to 53{\%} for candidates larger than 2 R⊕) and those at longer orbital periods (124{\%} for candidates outside of 50 day orbits versus 86{\%} for candidates inside of 50 day orbits). The gains are larger than expected from increasing the observing window from 13 months (Quarters 1-5) to 16 months (Quarters 1-6) even in regions of parameter space where one would have expected the previous catalogs to be complete. Analyses of planet frequencies based on previous catalogs will be affected by such incompleteness. The fraction of all planet candidate host stars with multiple candidates has grown from 17{\%} to 20{\%}, and the paucity of short-period giant planets in multiple systems is still evident. The progression toward smaller planets at longer orbital periods with each new catalog release suggests that Earth-size planets in the habitable zone are forthcoming if, indeed, such planets are abundant. {\textcopyright} 2013.

abstract = {Surveys searching for transiting exoplanets have found many more candidates than they have been able to confirm as true planets. This situation is especially acute with the Kepler survey, which has found over 2300 candidates but has to date confirmed only a small fraction of them as planets. I present here a general procedure that can quickly be applied to any planet candidate to calculate its false positive probability. This procedure takes into account the period, depth, duration, and shape of the signal; the colors of the target star; arbitrary spectroscopic or imaging follow-up observations; and informed assumptions about the populations and distributions of field stars and multiple-star properties. Applying these methods to a sample of known Kepler planets, I demonstrate that many signals can be validated with very limited follow-up observations: in most cases with only a spectrum and an adaptive optics image. Additionally, I demonstrate that this procedure can reliably identify false positive signals. Because of the computational efficiency of this analysis, it is feasible to apply it to all Kepler planet candidates in the near future, and it will streamline the follow-up efforts for Kepler and other current and future transit surveys. {\textcopyright} 2012.

The {\$}J{\$}, {\$}H{\$}, {\$}K1{\$}, and {\$}K2{\$} spectra from GPI demonstrate the extraordinarily red colors of the object, confirming it as the reddest substellar object observed to date. The significant flux increase throughout the infrared presents a challenging atmosphere to model with existing grids. Best-fit values vary from 1200 K to 1800 K for effective temperature and from 3.0 to 5.0 for log({\$}g{\$}), depending on which individual wavelength band is fit and which model suite is applied. The extreme redness of the companion can be partially reconciled by invoking a high-altitude layer of sub-micron dust particles, similar to dereddening approaches applied to the peculiar red field L-dwarf population. However, reconciling the HD 206893 B spectra with even those of the reddest low-gravity L-dwarf spectra still requires the contribution of additional atmospheric dust, potentially due to the debris disk environment in which the companion resides. Orbit fitting from four years of astrometric monitoring is consistent with a {\$}\backslashsim{\$}30-year period, orbital inclination of 147{\$}{\^{}}{\{}\backslashcirc{\}}{\$}, and semimajor axis of 10 au, well within the estimated disk inner radius of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}50 au.

Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},

First, there is an analytic solution that allows a quick parameter estimate, in particular of Rp. Second, the stellar density can be uniquely derived from the transit light curve alone. The stellar density can be used to immediately rule out a giant star (and hence a much larger than planetary companion) and can also be used to put an upper limit on the stellar and planet radius even considering slightly evolved stars. Third, the presence of an additional fully blended star that contaminates an eclipsing system to mimic a planet transit can be largely ruled out from the transit light curve given a spectral type for the central star. Fourth, the period can be estimated from a single-transit light curve and a measured spectral type. All of these applications can be used to select the best planet transit candidates for mass determination by radial velocity follow-up. To use these applications in practice, the photometric precision and time sampling of the light curve must be high (better than 0.005 mag precision and 5 minute time sampling).},

abstract = {Context. Many aspects of the design trade-off of a space-based instrument and its performance can best be tackled through simulations of the expected observations. The complex interplay of various noise sources in the course of the observations make such simulations an indispensable part of the assessment and design study of any space-based mission. Aims. We present a formalism to model and simulate photometric time series of CCD images by including models of the CCD and its electronics, the telescope optics, the stellar field, the jitter movements of the spacecraft, and all of the important natural noise sources. Methods. This formalism has been implemented in a versatile end-to-end simulation software tool, specifically designed for the PLATO (Planetary Transists and Oscillations of Stars) space mission to be operated from L2, but easily adaptable to similar types of missions. We call this tool Plato Simulator. Results. We provide a detailed description of several noise sources and discuss their properties in connection with the optical design, the allowable level of jitter, the quantum efficiency of the detectors, etc. The expected overall noise budget of generated light curves is computed, as a function of the stellar magnitude, for different sets of input parameters describing the instrument properties. The simulator is offered to the scientific community for future use. {\textcopyright} 2014 ESO.},

Astronomers are beginning to model the atmospheres and interiors of exoplanets and have developed a deeper understanding of processes of planet formation and evolution. However, we have yet to map out the full complexity of multi-planet architectures or to detect Earth analogues around nearby stars. Reaching these ambitious goals will require further improvements in instrumentation and new analysis tools. In this chapter, we provide an overview of five observational techniques that are currently employed in the detection of exoplanets: optical and IR Doppler measurements, transit photometry, direct imaging, microlensing, and astrometry. We provide a basic description of how each of these techniques works and discuss forefront developments that will result in new discoveries. We also highlight the observational limitations and synergies of each method and their connections to future space missions.},

For two thousand hierarchies, the new MSC provides distances, component's masses and periods, as well as supplementary information (astrometry, photometry, identifiers, orbits, notes). The MSC content and format are explained, its incompleteness and strong observational selection are stressed. Nevertheless, the MSC can be used for statistical studies and it is a valuable source for planning observations of multiple stars. Rare classes of stellar hierarchies found in the MSC (with 6 or 7 components, extremely eccentric orbits, planar and possibly resonant orbits, hosting planets) are briefly presented. High-order hierarchies have smaller velocity dispersion compared to triples and are often associated with moving groups. The paper concludes by the analysis of the ratio of periods and separations between inner and outer subsystems. In wide hierarchies, the ratio of semimajor axes, estimated statistically, is distributed between 3 and 300, with no evidence of dynamically unstable systems.},

abstract = {Recently, several groups have resolved a gap that bifurcates planets between the size of Earth and Neptune into two populations. The location and depth of this feature is an important signature of the physical processes that form and sculpt planets. In particular, planets residing in the radius gap are valuable probes of these processes as they may be undergoing the final stages of envelope loss. Here, we discuss two views of the radius gap by Fulton {\&} Petigura (2018; F18) and Van Eylen et al. (2018; V18). In V18, the gap is wider and more devoid of planets. This is due, in part, to V18's more precise measurements of planet radius {\$}R{\_}p{\$}. Thanks to Gaia, uncertainties in stellar radii Rstar are no longer the limiting uncertainties in determining {\$}R{\_}p{\$} for the majority of Kepler planets; instead, errors in {\$}R{\_}p/R{\_}\backslashstar{\$} dominate. V18's analysis incorporated short-cadence photometry along with constraints on mean stelar density that enabled more accurate determinations of {\$}R{\_}p/R{\_}\backslashstar{\$}. In the F18 analysis, less accurate {\$}R{\_}p/R{\_}\backslashstar{\$} blurs the boundary the radius gap. The differences in {\$}R{\_}p/R{\_}\backslashstar{\$} are largest at high impact parameter ({\$}b \backslashgtrsim 0.8{\$}) and often exceed 10{\%}. This motivates excluding high-{\$}b{\$} planets from demographic studies, but identifying such planets from long-cadence photometry alone is challenging. We show that transit duration can serve as an effective proxy, and we leverage this information to enhance the contrast between the super-Earth and sub-Neptune populations.},

abstract = {The quest for other habitable worlds and the search for life among them are major goals of modern astronomy. One way to make progress towards these goals is to obtain high-quality spectra of a large number of exoplanets over a broad range of wavelengths. While concepts currently investigated in the United States are focused on visible/NIR wavelengths, where the planets are probed in reflected light, a compelling alternative to characterize planetary atmospheres is the mid-infrared waveband (5–20 $\mu$m). Indeed, mid-infrared observations provide key information on the presence of an atmosphere, the surface conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, habitability), and the atmospheric composition in important species such as H2O, CO2, O3, CH4, and N2O. This information is essential to investigate the potential habitability of exoplanets and to make progress towards the search for life in the Universe. Obtaining high-quality mid-infrared spectra of exoplanets from the ground is however extremely challenging due to the overwhelming brightness and turbulence of the Earth's atmosphere. In this paper, we present a concept of space-based mid-infrared interferometer that can tackle this observing challenge and discuss the main technological developments required to launch such a sophisticated instrument.},

abstract = {We present a study on the effect of undetected stellar companions on the derived planetary radii for Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs). The current production of the KOI list assumes that each KOI is a single star. Not accounting for stellar multiplicity statistically biases the planets toward smaller radii. The bias toward smaller radii depends on the properties of the companion stars and whether the planets orbit the primary or the companion stars. Defining a planetary radius correction factor, XR, we find that if the KOIs are assumed to be single, then, on average, the planetary radii may be underestimated by a factor of 〈XR〉 ≈ 1.5. If typical radial velocity and high-resolution imaging observations are performed and no companions are detected, then this factor reduces to 〈XR〉 ≈ 1.2. The correction factor 〈XR〉 is dependent on the primary star properties and ranges from 〈XR〉 ≈ 1.6 for A and F stars to 〈XR〉 ≈ 1.2 for K and M stars. For missions like K2 and TESS where the stars may be closer than the stars in the Kepler target sample, observational vetting (primary imaging) reduces the radius correction factor to 〈XR〉 ≈ 1.1. Finally, we show that if the stellar multiplicity rates are not accounted for correctly, then occurrence rate calculations for Earth-sized planets may overestimate the frequency of small planets by as much as 15{\%}-20{\%}.},

abstract = {We present a new method for differentiating between planetary transits and eclipsing binaries on the basis of the presence of ellipsoidal light variations. These variations can be used to detect stellar secondaries with masses of {\~{}}0.2 Msolar orbiting Sun-like stars at a photometric accuracy level that has already been achieved in transit surveys. By removing candidates exhibiting this effect, it is possible to greatly reduce the number of objects requiring spectroscopic follow-up with large telescopes. Unlike the usual candidate selection methods, which are based primarily on the estimated radius of the orbiting object, this technique is not biased against bona fide planets and brown dwarfs with large radii because the amplitude of the effect depends on the transiting object's mass and orbital distance. In many binary systems where a candidate planetary transit is actually due to the partial eclipse of two normal stars, the presence of flux variations due to the gravity darkening effect will show the true nature of these systems.  We show that many of the recent OGLE III photometric transit candidates exhibit the presence of significant variations in their light curves and are likely to be due to stellar secondaries. We find that the light curves of white dwarf transits generally will not mimic those of small planets because of significant gravitationally induced flux variations. We discuss the relative merits of methods used to detect transit candidates that are due to stellar blends rather than planets. We outline how photometric observations taken in two bands can be used to detect the presence of stellar blends.},

Using the homogeneous Kepler stellar properties derived using Gaia Data Release 2 by Berger et al.

We measure the stellar mass dependence of the planet radius valley to be dlog Rp/dlog M? = 0.26+0−0..2116, consistent with the slope predicted by both photoevaporation (0.24–0.35) and core-powered mass-loss (0.33). We also find first evidence of a stellar age dependence of the planet populations straddling the radius valley. Specifically, we determine that the fraction of super-Earths (1–1.8 R☉) to sub-Neptunes (1.8–3.5 R☉) increases from 0.61 ±0.09 at young ages ({\textless}1 Gyr) to 1.00 ±0.10 at old ages ({\textgreater}1 Gyr), consistent with the prediction by core-powered mass-loss that the mechanism shaping the radius valley operates over Gyr timescales. We confirm the existence of planets within the hot super-Earth “desert” (2.2 {\textless}Rp {\textless}3.8 R☉, Fp {\textgreater}650 F☉) and show that these planets are preferentially orbiting more evolved stars compared to other planets at similar incident fluxes. In addition, we identify candidates for cool (Fp {\textless}20 F☉) inflated Jupiters, present a revised list of habitable zone candidates, and find that the ages of single- and multiple-transiting planet systems are statistically indistinguishable.},

abstract = {Ten days of commissioning data (Quarter 0) and 33 days of science data (Quarter 1) yield instrumental flux time series of 150,000 stars that were combed for transit events, termed threshold crossing events(TCE), each having a total detection statistic above 7.1$\sigma$. TCE light curves are modeled as star+planet systems. Those returning a companion radius smaller than 2R J are assigned a Kepler Object of Interest (KOI) number. The raw flux, pixel flux, and flux-weighted centroids of every KOI are scrutinized to assess the likelihood of being an astrophysical false positive versus the likelihood of being a planetary companion. This vetting using Kepler data is referred to as data validation (DV). Herein, we describe the DV metrics and graphics used to identify viable planet candidates amongst the KOIs. Light curve modeling tests for (1) the difference in depth of the odd- versus even-numbered transits, (2) evidence of ellipsoidal variations, and (3) evidence of a secondary eclipse event at phase = 0.5. Flux-weighted centroids are used to test for signals correlated with transit events with a magnitude and direction indicative of a background eclipsing binary. Centroid time series are complimented by analysis of images taken in-transit versus out-of-transit, the difference often revealing the pixel contributing the most to the flux change during transit. Examples are shown to illustrate each test. Candidates passing DV are submitted to ground-based observers for further false-positive elimination or confirmation/characterization. {\textcopyright} 2010. The American Astronomical Society.},

abstract = {The Kepler Mission revolutionized exoplanet science and stellar astrophysics by obtaining highly precise photometry of over 200,000 stars over 4 years. A critical piece of information to exploit Kepler data is its selection function, since all targets had to be selected from a sample of half a million stars on the Kepler CCDs using limited information. Here we use Gaia DR2 to reconstruct the Kepler selection function and explore possible biases with respect to evolutionary state, stellar multiplicity, and kinematics. We find that the Kepler target selection is nearly complete for stars brighter than {\$}Kp {\textless} 14{\$} mag and was effective at selecting main-sequence stars, with the fraction of observed stars decreasing from 95{\%} to 60{\%} between {\$}14 {\textless} Kp {\textless} 16{\$} mag. We find that the observed fraction for subgiant stars is only 10{\%} lower, confirming that a significant number of subgiants selected for observation were believed to be main-sequence stars. Conversely we find a strong selection bias against low-luminosity red giant stars ({\$}R \backslashapprox 3-5 R{\_}\backslashodot{\$}, {\$}T{\_}{\{}eff{\}} \backslashapprox 5500{\$}K), dropping from 90{\%} at {\$}Kp = 14{\$} mag to below 30{\%} at {\$}Kp = 16{\$} mag, confirming that the target selection was efficient at distinguishing dwarfs from giants. We compare the Gaia Re-normalized Unit Weight Error (RUWE) values of the observed and non-observed main sequence stars and find a difference in elevated ({\$}{\textgreater}{\$} 1.2) RUWE values at {\$}\backslashsim\backslash,5\backslash,\backslashsigma{\$} significance, suggesting that the Kepler target selection shows some bias against either close or wide binaries. We furthermore use the Gaia proper motions to show that the Kepler selection function was unbiased with respect to kinematics.},

We use the individual photometry in each bandpass as well as the colors of KOI 565 and other nearby stars to determine that the source of the transit signal initially detected by Kepler is not due to a super-Earth-size planet around KOI 565. Instead, we find the source to be a background eclipsing binary star located $\backslash$sim15 arcsec to the North of KOI 565. We discuss future prospects for using high-precision multi-color photometry from the GTC to determine whether additional Kepler planet candidates have a planetary nature or are instead false positives (e.g., foreground or background eclipsing binaries or hierarchical triple systems). Our approach is complementary to multi-color follow-up observations of Kepler planet candidates currently being conducted with the Spitzer space telescope in the infrared as well as to other follow-up techniques.},

abstract = {We present high-resolution speckle interferometric imaging observations of TESS exoplanet host stars using the NN-EXPLORE NESSI instrument the at the 3.5-m WIYN telescope. Eight TOIs, that were originally discovered by Kepler, were previously observed using the Differential Speckle Survey Instrument (DSSI). Speckle observations of 186 TESS stars were carried out and 45 (24{\%}) likely bound companions were detected. This is approximately the number of companions we would expect to observe given the established 46{\%} binarity rate in exoplanet host stars. For the detected binaries, the distribution of stellar mass ratio is consistent with that of the standard Raghavan distribution and may show a decrease in high-q systems as the binary separation increases. The distribution of binary orbital periods, however, is not consistent with the standard Ragahavan model and our observations support the premise that exoplanet-hosting stars with binary companions have, in general, wider orbital separations than field binaries. We find that exoplanet-hosting binary star systems show a distribution peaking near 100 au, higher than the 40-50 au peak that is observed for field binaries. This fact led to earlier suggestions that planet formation is suppressed in close binaries.},

abstract = {The Kepler mission has provided a wealth of data, revealing new insights in time-domain astronomy. However, Kepler's single band-pass has limited studies to a single wavelength. In this work we build a data-driven, pixel-level model for the Pixel Response Function (PRF) of Kepler targets, modeling the image data from the spacecraft. Our model is sufficiently flexible to capture known detector effects, such as non-linearity, intra-pixel sensitivity variations, and focus change. In theory, the shape of the Kepler PRF should also be weakly wavelength dependent, due to optical chromatic aberration and wavelength dependent detector response functions. We are able to identify these predicted shape changes to the PRF using the residuals between Kepler data and our model. In this work, we show that these PRF changes correspond to wavelength variability in Kepler targets using a small sample of eclipsing binaries. Using our model, we demonstrate that pixel-level light curves of eclipsing binaries show variable eclipse depths, ellipsoidal modulation and limb darkening. These changes at the pixel level are consistent with multi-wavelength photometry. Our work suggests each pixel in the Kepler data of a single target has a different effective wavelength, ranging from {\$}\backslashapprox{\$} 550-750 {\$}nm{\$}. In this proof of concept, we demonstrate our model, and discuss possible use cases for the wavelength dependent Pixel Response Function of Kepler. These use cases include characterizing variable systems, and vetting exoplanet discoveries at the pixel level. The chromatic PRF of Kepler is due to weak wavelength dependence in the optical systems and detector of the telescope, and similar chromatic PRFs are expected in other similar telescopes, notably the NASA TESS telescope.},

I then outline the methodology and pitfalls to measuring exoplanet demographics in practice. I next review the methods of detecting exoplanets, focusing on the ability of these methods to detect wide separation planets. For the purposes of this review, I define wide separation as separations beyond the 'snow line' of the protoplanetary disk, which is at roughly {\$}\backslashsim3{\$} au for a sunlike star. I note that this definition is somewhat arbitrary, and the practical boundary depends on the host star mass, planet mass and radius, and detection method. I review the approximate scaling relations for the signal-to-noise ratio for the detectability of exoplanets as a function of the relevant physical parameters, including the host star properties. I provide abroad overview of what has already been learned from the transit, radial velocity, direct imaging, and microlensing methods. I outline the challenges to synthesizing the demographics using different methods and discuss some preliminary first steps in this direction.

abstract = {Kepler seeks to detect sequences of transits of Earth-size exoplanets orbiting solar-like stars. Such transit signals are on the order of 100 ppm. The high photometric precision demanded by Kepler requires detailed knowledge of how the Kepler pixels respond to starlight during a nominal observation. This information is provided by the Kepler pixel response function (PRF), defined as the composite of Kepler's optical point-spread function, integrated spacecraft pointing jitter during a nominal cadence and other systematic effects. To provide sub-pixel resolution, the PRF is represented as a piecewise-continuous polynomial on a sub-pixel mesh. This continuous representation allows the prediction of a star's flux value on any pixel given the star's pixel position. The advantages and difficulties of this polynomial representation are discussed, including characterization of spatial variation in the PRF and the smoothing of discontinuities between sub-pixel polynomial patches. On-orbit super-resolution measurements of the PRF across the Kepler field of view are described. Two uses of the PRF are presented: the selection of pixels for each star that maximizes the photometric signal-to-noise ratio for that star, and PRF-fitted centroids which provide robust and accurate stellar positions on the CCD, primarily used for attitude and plate scale tracking. Good knowledge of the PRF has been a critical component for the successful collection of high-precision photometry by Kepler. {\textcopyright} 2010. The American Astronomical Society.

Based on the planet candidates in the Kepler DR25 data release, I first generate a continuous density map of planet distribution using a Gaussian kernel model and correct the geometric factor that the discovery space of a transit event decreases along with the increase of planetary orbital distance. Then I fit two exponential decay functions of detection efficiency along with the increase of planetary orbital distance and the decrease of planetary radius. Finally, the density map of planet distribution is compensated for the fitted exponential decay functions of detection efficiency to obtain a relative occurrence rate distribution of terrestrial planets. The result shows two regions with planet abundance: one corresponds to planets with radii between 0.5 and 1.5 R{\_}Earth within 0.2 AU, the other corresponds to planets with radii between 1.5 and 3 R{\_}Earth beyond 0.5 AU.

All of the previously known ultrashort-period planets are either hot Jupiters, with sizes above 10 Earth radii (R⊕), or apparently rocky planets smaller than 2 R⊕. Such lack of planets of intermediate size (the ‘hot Neptune desert') has been interpreted as the inability of low-mass planets to retain any hydrogen/helium (H/He) envelope in the face of strong stellar irradiation. Here we report the discovery of an ultrashort-period planet with a radius of 4.6 R⊕ and a mass of 29 M⊕, firmly in the hot Neptune desert. Data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite3 revealed transits of the bright Sun-like star LTT 9779 every 0.79 days. The planet's mean density is similar to that of Neptune, and according to thermal evolution models, it has a H/He-rich envelope constituting 9.0−2.9+2.7{\%} of the total mass. With an equilibrium temperature around 2,000 K, it is unclear how this ‘ultrahot Neptune' managed to retain such an envelope. Follow-up observations of the planet's atmosphere to better understand its origin and physical nature will be facilitated by the star's brightness (Vmag = 9.8).},

abstract = {A recent observational study suggests that the occurrence of hot Jupiters (HJs) around solar type stars is correlated with stellar clustering. We study a new scenario for HJ formation, called "Flyby Induced High-e Migration", that may help explain this correlation. In this scenario, stellar flybys excite the eccentricity and inclination of an outer planet (or brown dwarf) at large distance (10-300 au), which then triggers high-e migration of an inner cold Jupiter (at a few au) through the combined effects of von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) eccentricity oscillation and tidal dissipation. Using semi-analytical calculations of the effective ZLK inclination window for the inclination, together with numerical simulations of stellar flybys, we obtain the analytic estimate for the HJ occurrence rate in this formation scenario. We find that this "flyby induced high-e migration" could account for a significant fraction of the observed HJ population, although the result depends on several uncertain parameters, including the density and lifetime of birth stellar clusters, and the occurrence rate of the initial "cold Jupiter + outer planet" systems.},

abstract = {Dynamical histories of planetary systems, as well as atmospheric evolution of highly irradiated planets, can be studied by characterizing the ultra-short-period planet population, which the TESS mission is particularly well suited to discover. Here, we report on the follow-up of a transit signal detected in the TESS sector 19 photometric time series of the M3.0 V star TOI-1685 (2MASS J04342248+4302148). We confirm the planetary nature of the transit signal, which has a period of P{\_}b=0.6691403+0.0000023-0.0000021 d, using precise radial velocity measurements taken with the CARMENES spectrograph. From the joint photometry and radial velocity analysis, we estimate the following parameters for TOI-1685 b: a mass of M{\_}b=3.78+/-0.63 M{\_}Earth, a radius of R{\_}b=1.70+/-0.07 R{\_}Earth, which together result in a bulk density of rho{\_}b=4.21+0.95-0.82 g/cm3, and an equilibrium temperature of Teq{\_}b=1069+/-16 K. TOI-1685 b is the least dense ultra-short period planet around an M dwarf known to date. TOI-1685 b is also one of the hottest transiting Earth-size planets with accurate dynamical mass measurements, which makes it a particularly attractive target for thermal emission spectroscopy. Additionally, we report a further non-transiting planet candidate in the system, TOI-1685[c], with an orbital period of P{\_}[c]=9.02+0.10-0.12 d.},

abstract = {Many hot Jupiters (HJs) are detected by the Doppler and transit techniques. From surveys using these two techniques, however, the measured HJ occurrence rates differ by a factor of two or more. Using the California Planet Survey sample and the Kepler sample, we investigate the causes for this difference in the HJ occurrence rate. First, we find that 12.8{\%} ± 0.24{\%} of HJs are misidentified in the Kepler mission because of photometric dilution and subgiant contamination. Second, we explore the differences between the Doppler sample and the Kepler sample that can account for the different HJ occurrence rate. Third, we discuss how to measure the fundamental HJ occurrence rates by synthesizing the results from the Doppler and Kepler surveys. The fundamental HJ occurrence rates are measures of the HJ occurrence rate as a function of stellar multiplicity and evolutionary stage, e.g., the HJ occurrence rate for single and multiple stars or for main-sequence and subgiant stars. While we find qualitative evidence that HJs occur less frequently in subgiants and multiple stellar systems, we conclude that our current knowledge of stellar properties and the stellar multiplicity rate is too limited for us to reach any quantitative result for the fundamental HJ occurrence rates. This concern extends to $\eta$Earth, the occurrence rate of Earth-like planets.},

@article{Lillo-Box2014,
abstract = {Context. The Kepler mission has discovered thousands of planet candidates. Currently, some of them have already been discarded; more than 200 have been confirmed by follow-up observations (most by radial velocity and few by other methods), and several hundreds have been validated. However, the large majority of the candidates are still awaiting for confirmation. Thus, priorities (in terms of the probability of the candidate being a real planet) must be established for subsequent radial velocity observations. Aims. The motivation of this work is to provide a set of isolated (good) host candidates to be further tested by other techniques that allow confirmation of the planet. As a complementary goal, we aim to identify close companions of the candidates that could have contaminated the light curve of the planet host due to the large pixel size of the Kepler CCD and its typical PSF of around 6 arcsec. Both goals can also provide robust statistics about the multiplicity of the Kepler hosts. Methods. We used the AstraLux North instrument located at the 2.2 m telescope in the Calar Alto Observatory (Almer{\'{i}}a, Spain) to obtain diffraction-limited images of 174 Kepler objects of interest. A sample of demoted Kepler objects of interest (with rejected planet candidates) is used as a control for comparison of multiplicity statistics. The lucky-imaging technique used in this work is compared to other adaptive optics and speckle imaging observations of Kepler planet host candidates. To that end, we define a new parameter, the blended source confidence level (BSC), to assess the probability of an object to have blended non-detected eclipsing binaries capable of producing the detected transit. Results. We find that 67.2{\%} of the observed Kepler hosts are isolated within our detectability limits, and 32.8{\%} have at least one visual companion at angular separations below 6 arcsec. Indeed, we find close companions (below 3 arcsec) for the 17.2{\%} of the sample. The planet properties of this sample of non-isolated hosts are revised according to the presence of such close companions. We report one possible S-type binary (KOI-3158), where the five planet candidates would orbit one of the components of the system. We also report three possible false positives (KOIs 1230.01, 3649.01, and 3886.01) due to the presence of close companions that modify candidate properties such that they cannot be considered as planets anymore. The BSC parameter is calculated for all the isolated targets and compared to both the value prior to any high-resolution image and, when possible, to observations from previous high-spatial resolution surveys in the Kepler sample. {\textcopyright} 2014 ESO.},

@article{Twicken2018,
abstract = {The Kepler Mission was designed to identify and characterize transiting planets in the Kepler Field of View and to determine their occurrence rates. Emphasis was placed on identification of Earth-size planets orbiting in the Habitable Zone of their host stars. Science data were acquired for a period of four years. Long-cadence data with 29.4 min sampling were obtained for ∼200,000 individual stellar targets in at least one observing quarter in the primary Kepler Mission. Light curves for target stars are extracted in the Kepler Science Data Processing Pipeline, and are searched for transiting planet signatures. A Threshold Crossing Event is generated in the transit search for targets where the transit detection threshold is exceeded and transit consistency checks are satisfied. These targets are subjected to further scrutiny in the Data Validation (DV) component of the Pipeline. Transiting planet candidates are characterized in DV, and light curves are searched for additional planets after transit signatures are modeled and removed. A suite of diagnostic tests is performed on all candidates to aid in discrimination between genuine transiting planets and instrumental or astrophysical false positives. Data products are generated per target and planet candidate to document and display transiting planet model fit and diagnostic test results. These products are exported to the Exoplanet Archive at the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute, and are available to the community. We describe the DV architecture and diagnostic tests, and provide a brief overview of the data products. Transiting planet modeling and the search for multiple planets on individual targets are described in a companion paper. The final revision of the Kepler Pipeline code base is available to the general public through GitHub. The Kepler Pipeline has also been modified to support the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) Mission which is expected to commence in 2018.},

@article{Longmore2021,
abstract = {It has recently been shown that stellar clustering plays an important role in shaping the properties of planetary systems. We investigate how the multiplicity distributions and orbital periods of planetary systems depend on the 6D phase space density of stars surrounding planet host systems. We find that stars in high stellar phase space density environments (overdensities) have a factor 1.6 - 2.0 excess in the number of single planet systems compared to stars in low stellar phase space density environments (the field). The multiplicity distribution of planets around field stars is much flatter (i.e. there is a greater fraction of multi-planet systems) than in overdensities. This result is primarily driven by the combined facts that: (i) `hot Jupiters' (HJs) are almost exclusively found in overdensities; (ii) HJs are predominantly observed to be single-planet systems. Nevertheless, we find that the difference in multiplicity is even more pronounced when only considering planets in the Kepler sample, which contains few HJs. This suggests that the Kepler dichotomy -- an apparent excess of systems with a single transiting planet -- plausibly arises from environmental perturbations. In overdensities, the orbital periods of single-planet systems are smaller than orbital periods of multiple-planet systems. As this difference is more pronounced in overdensities, the mechanism responsible for this effect may be enhanced by stellar clustering. Taken together, the pronounced dependence of planetary multiplicity and orbital period distributions on stellar clustering provides a potentially powerful tool to diagnose the impact of environment on the formation and evolution of planetary systems.},

@article{Bouma2018,
abstract = {Wide-field surveys for transiting planets, such as the NASA Kepler and TESS missions, are usually conducted without knowing which stars have binary companions. Unresolved and unrecognized binaries give rise to systematic errors in planet occurrence rates, including misclassified planets and mistakes in completeness corrections. The individual errors can have different signs, making it difficult to anticipate the net effect on inferred occurrence rates. Here we use simplified models of signal-to-noise limited transit surveys to try and clarify the situation. We derive a formula for the apparent occurrence rate density measured by an observer who falsely assumes all stars are single. The formula depends on the binary fraction; the mass function of the secondary stars; and the true occurrence of planets around primaries, secondaries, and single stars. It also takes into account the Malmquist bias by which binaries are over-represented in flux-limited samples. Application of the formula to an idealized Kepler-like survey shows that for planets larger than 2 R⊕, the net systematic error is of order 5{\%}. In particular, unrecognized binaries are unlikely to be the reason for the apparent discrepancies between hot Jupiter occurrence rates measured in different surveys. For smaller planets the errors are potentially larger: the occurrence of Earth-sized planets could be overestimated by as much as 50{\%}. We also show that whenever high-resolution imaging reveals a transit host star to be a binary, the planet is usually more likely to orbit the primary star than the secondary star.},

@article{Hamer2020,
abstract = {It has been unambiguously shown in both individual systems and at the population level that hot Jupiters experience tidal inspiral before the end of their host stars' main sequence lifetimes. Ultra-short-period (USP) planets have orbital periods P {\textless} 1 day, rocky compositions, and are expected to experience tidal decay on similar timescales to hot Jupiters if the efficiency of tidal dissipation inside their host stars parameterized as Q0∗ is independent of P and/or secondary mass Mp. Any difference between the two classes of systems would reveal that a constant Q0∗ model is insufficient. If USP planets experience tidal inspiral, then USP planet systems will be relatively young compared to similar stars without USP planets. Because it is a proxy for relative age, we calculate the Galactic velocity dispersions of USP planet candidate host and non-host stars using data from Gaia Data Release 2 supplemented with ground-based radial velocities. We find that main sequence USP planet candidate host stars have kinematics consistent with similar stars in the Kepler field without observed USP planets. This indicates that USP planet hosts have similar ages as field stars and that USP planets do not experience tidal inspiral during the main sequence lifetimes of their host stars. The survival of USP planets requires that Q0∗ {\&} 107 at P ≈ 0.7 day and Mp ≈ 2.6 M⊕. This result demands that Q0∗ depend on the orbital period and/or mass of the secondary in the range 0.5 days .

@article{Petrovich2018,
abstract = {Over a hundred rocky planets orbiting Sun-like stars in very short orbital periods (. 1 day) have been discovered by the Kepler mission. These planets, known as ultra-short-period (USP) planets, are unlikely to have formed locally, or have attained their current orbits when their birth protoplanetary disks were still present. Instead, they must have migrated in later in life. Here we propose that these planets reach their current orbits by high-eccentricity migration. In a scaled-down version of the dynamics that may have been experienced by their high mass analog, the hot Jupiters, these planets reach high eccentricities via chaotic secular interactions with their companion planets and then undergo orbital circularization due to dissipation of tides raised on the planet. This proposal is motivated by the following observations: planetary systems observed by Kepler often contain several super-Earths with non-negligible eccentricities and inclinations, and possibly extending beyond ∼ AU distances; while only a small fraction of USP planets have known transiting companions, and none closely spaced, we argue that most of them should have companions at periods of ∼ 10 − 50 days. The outer sibling planets, through secular chaos, can remove angular momentum from the inner most planet, originally at periods of ∼ 5 − 10 days. When the latter reaches an eccentricity higher than 0.8, it is tidally captured by the central star and becomes an USP planet. This scenario naturally explains the observation that most USP planets have significantly more distant transiting companions compared to their counterparts at slightly longer periods (1 − 3 days), a feature un-accounted for in other proposed scenarios. Our model also predicts that USP planets should have: (i) spin-orbit angles, and inclinations relative to outer planets, in the range of ∼ 10◦ − 50◦; (ii) several outer planetary companions extending to beyond ∼ 1 AU distances, both of which may be tested by TESS and its follow-up observations.},

It has been proposed that USP planets are the solid cores of hot Jupiters that lost their gaseous envelopes due to photo-evaporation or Roche lobe overflow. We test this hypothesis by asking whether USP planets are associated with metal-rich stars, as has long been observed for hot Jupiters. We find the metallicity distributions of USP-planet and hot-Jupiter hosts to be significantly different (p = 3 ×10-4), based on Keck spectroscopy of Kepler stars. Evidently, the sample of USP planets is not dominated by the evaporated cores of hot Jupiters. The metallicity distribution of stars with USP planets is indistinguishable from that of stars with short-period planets with sizes between 2-4 R⊕. Thus it remains possible that the USP planets are the solid cores of formerly gaseous planets smaller than Neptune.},

By analyzing a sample of 102 Kepler and K2 multi-planet systems, we measure the minimum difference $\Delta$I between the orbital inclinations, as a function of the orbital distance of the innermost planet. This is accomplished by fitting all the planetary signals simultaneously, constrained by an external estimate of the stellar mean density. We find $\Delta$I to be larger when the inner orbit is smaller, a trend that does not appear to be a selection effect. We find that planets with a/R∗{\textless}5 have a dispersion in $\Delta$I of 6:7 ± 0:6 degrees, while planets with 5 {\textless} a/R∗{\textless} 12 have a dispersion of 2:0 ± 0:1 degrees.

@article{Borucki2011,
abstract = {On 2011 February 1 the Kepler mission released data for 156,453 stars observed from the beginning of the science observations on 2009 May 2 through September 16. There are 1235 planetary candidates with transit-like signatures detected in this period. These are associated with 997 host stars. Distributions of the characteristics of the planetary candidates are separated into five class sizes: 68 candidates of approximately Earth-size (Rp < 1.25 R⊕), 288 super-Earth-size (1.25 R⊕ ≤ R p < 2 R⊕), 662 Neptune-size (2 R ⊕ ≤ Rp < 6 R⊕), 165 Jupiter-size (6 R⊕ ≤ Rp < 15 R ⊕), and 19 up to twice the size of Jupiter (15 R ⊕ ≤ Rp < 22 R⊕). In the temperature range appropriate for the habitable zone, 54 candidates are found with sizes ranging from Earth-size to larger than that of Jupiter. Six are less than twice the size of the Earth. Over 74\% of the planetary candidates are smaller than Neptune. The observed number versus size distribution of planetary candidates increases to a peak at two to three times the Earth-size and then declines inversely proportional to the area of the candidate. Our current best estimates of the intrinsic frequencies of planetary candidates, after correcting for geometric and sensitivity biases, are 5\% for Earth-size candidates, 8\% for super-Earth-size candidates, 18% for Neptune-size candidates, 2% for Jupiter-size candidates, and 0.1% for very large candidates; a total of 0.34 candidates per star. Multi-candidate, transiting systems are frequent; 17% of the host stars have multi-candidate systems, and 34% of all the candidates are part of multi-candidate systems. {\textcopyright} 2011.

@article{Santerne2015,
abstract = {The statistical validation of transiting exoplanets proved to be an efficient technique to secure the nature of small exoplanet signals which cannot be established by purely spectroscopic means. However, the spectroscopic diagnoses are providing us with useful constraints on the presence of blended stellar contaminants. In this paper, we present how a contaminating star affects the measurements of the various spectroscopic diagnoses as a function of the parameters of the target and contaminating stars using the model implemented into the PASTIS planet-validation software. We find particular cases for which a blend might produce a large radial velocity signal but no bisector variation. It might also produce a bisector variation anticorrelated with the radial velocity one, as in the case of stellar spots. In those cases, the full width at half-maximum variation provides complementary constraints. These results can be used to constrain blend scenarios for transiting planet candidates or radial velocity planets. We review all the spectroscopic diagnoses reported in the literature so far, especially the ones to monitor the line asymmetry. We estimate their uncertainty and compare their sensitivity to blends. Based on that, we recommend the use of BiGauss which is the most sensitive diagnosis to monitor line-profile asymmetry. In this paper, we also investigate the sensitivity of the radial velocities to constrain blend scenarios and develop a formalism to estimate the level of dilution of a blended signal. Finally, we apply our blend model to re-analyse the spectroscopic diagnoses of HD 16702, an unresolved face-on binary which exhibits bisector variations.},

@article{Diaz2014,
abstract = {A large fraction of the smallest transiting planet candidates discovered by the Kepler and CoRoT space missions cannot be confirmed by a dynamical measurement of the mass using currently available observing facilities. To establish their planetary nature, the concept of planet validation has been advanced. This technique compares the probability of the planetary hypothesis against that of all reasonably conceivable alternative false positive (FP) hypotheses. The candidate is considered as validated if the posterior probability of the planetary hypothesis is sufficiently larger than the sum of the probabilities of all FP scenarios. In this paper, we present PASTIS, the Planet Analysis and Small Transit Investigation Software, a tool designed to perform a rigorous model comparison of the hypotheses involved in the problem of planet validation, and to fully exploit the information available in the candidate light curves. PASTIS self-consistently models the transit light curves and follow-up observations. Its object-oriented structure offers a large flexibility for defining the scenarios to be compared. The performance is explored using artificial transit light curves of planets and FPs with a realistic error distribution obtained from a Kepler light curve. We find that data support the correct hypothesis strongly only when the signal is high enough (transit signal-to-noise ratio above 50 for the planet case) and remain inconclusive otherwise. PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO) shall provide transits with high enough signal-to-noise ratio, but to establish the true nature of the vast majority of Kepler and CoRoT transit candidates additional data or strong reliance on hypotheses priors is needed. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

abstract = {The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) will search for planets transiting bright and nearby stars. TESS has been selected by NASA for launch in 2017 as an Astrophysics Explorer mission. The spacecraft will be placed into a highly elliptical 13.7-day orbit around the Earth. During its two-year mission, TESS will employ four wide-field optical CCD cameras to monitor at least 200,000 main-sequence dwarf stars with I = 4-13 for temporary drops in brightness caused by planetary transits. Each star will be observed for an interval ranging from one month to one year, depending mainly on the star's ecliptic latitude. The longest observing intervals will be for stars near the ecliptic poles, which are the optimal locations for follow-up observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. Brightness measurements of preselected target stars will be recorded every 2 min, and full frame images will be recorded every 30 min. TESS stars will be 10-100 times brighter than those surveyed by the pioneering Kepler mission. This will make TESS planets easier to characterize with follow-up observations. TESS is expected to find more than a thousand planets smaller than Neptune, including dozens that are comparable in size to the Earth. Public data releases will occur every four months, inviting immediate community-wide efforts to study the new planets. The TESS legacy will be a catalog of the nearest and brightest stars hosting transiting planets, which will endure as highly favorable targets for detailed investigations.},

@article{Cohen2003,
abstract = {Element-by-element we have combined the optical components in the three 2MASS cameras, and incorporated detector quantum efficiency curves and site-specific atmospheric transmissions, to create three relative spectral response curves (RSRs). We provide absolute 2MASS attributes associated with "zero magnitude" in the JHKs bands so that these RSRs may be used for synthetic photometry. The RSRs tie 2MASS to the Cohen-Walker-Witteborn framework of absolute photometry and spectra for the purpose of using 2MASS data to support the development of absolute calibrators for IRAC and pairwise cross-calibrators between all three SIRTF instruments. We examine the robustness of these RSRs to changes in water vapor within a night. We compare the observed 2MASS magnitudes of 33 stars (converted from the precision optical calibrators of Landolt and Carter-Meadows into absolute infrared calibrators from 1.2-35 um with our predictions, thereby deriving 2MASS "zero point offsets" from the ensemble. These offsets are the final ingredients essential to merge 2MASS $JHK_{s}$ data with other absolutely calibrated bands and stellar spectra, and to support the creation of faint calibration stars for SIRTF.},

@article{Dotter2016,
abstract = {I describe a method to transform a set of stellar evolution tracks onto a uniform basis and then interpolate within that basis to construct stellar isochrones. The method accommodates a broad range of stellar types, from substellar objects to high-mass stars, and phases of evolution, from the pre-main sequence to the white dwarf cooling sequence. I discuss situations in which stellar physics leads to departures from the otherwise monotonic relation between initial stellar mass and lifetime and how these may be dealt with in isochrone construction. I close with convergence tests and recommendations for the number of points in the uniform basis and the mass between tracks in the original grid required in order to achieve a certain level of accuracy in the resulting isochrones. The programs that implement these methods are free and open-source; they may be obtained from the project webpage.},
